## Current and Fresh Research Topics
Fresh research topics not necessarily already come with published articles. We assume results will be published soon:
- Digital Twins and Digital Shadows in Engineering and Production
- SysML 2.0
- Modelling in Production (fitting to Internet of Production Excellence Cluster)
