#### Introduction to Software Engineering (SWT, in German)

This lecture introduces the foundations for the engineering of complex 
software systems. Covered topics are development process models, 
requirements elicitation, software architecture and design as well as 
the implementation, generation and quality assurance with tests. The 
lecture uses primarily the modeling language UML.

#### Software Language Engineering (SLE)

"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." Ludwig 
Wittgenstein. This is even more true when humans communicate with 
computers. The course deals with the concepts of language definition, 
such as metamodels, grammars, editors. And it disussed the various 
forms of use of software languages, e.g. for modeling software or 
systems, for simulations, for testing, for defining erequirments, legal 
texts, etc. Examples such as UML, domain-specific languages ​​(DSL), XML 
and semantic analysis and generation techniques are discussed. DSLs are 
always suitable where non-computer scientists deal with computers and 
have to describe complex issues using models.

#### Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSSE) +

#### Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSSE)

The lecture elaborates on model-based development of complex 
cyber-physical systems. It covers the functional view of models in the 
systems development process, simulation, the analysis of models, and 
their evolution by refactoring. The modeling languages UML and SysML as 
well as broadly used Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) e.g. for 
architectures are examined. The lecture provides insight into 
model-based software and systems engineering and investigates the 
cross-domain development of systems using modeling languages and 
corresponding tools. 

The two lectures are held jointly, because even though Software 
Engineering and Systems Engineering have a different focus, modern 
mechanical systems are to a large extent controlled by 
network-intensive software functions, sometimes embedded in digital 
twins and thus an integrated software/systems view on a joint modeling 
approach is inevitable. We can see this integrative need e.g. by the 
overlap between the SysML and UML modeling languages.

#### Innovations in Software Engineering (ISE)

This leacture is decicated to Ph.D. students and potentially Master 
students, who know about all foundational lectures on Software 
Engineering, MBSE, and SLE. The lecture topics are subject to change 
every year. recently we discussed  topics including:     Modeling 
Language Variability,    Towards Architectural Programming of Embedded 
Systems,    System Model-based Definition of Modeling Language 
Semantics,    Java Best Practices,    V-Model XT,    Extreme 
Programming and Agile Methods,    Compositional Model based Software 
Engineering,    A formal technique for evolving hierarchically 
decomposed systems,    Semantic of Modelling Languages, Model Based 
Artificial Intelligence, Smart Verification of UML and SysML Models.

#### Digitalization (Judith Michael, Bernhard Rumpe 

The lecture "Digitalization" explores and discusses digitalisation from 
different perspectives of informatics: We investigate fundamentals of 
the terms digitalization, digitization and digital transformation, its 
classification in the discipline informatics, relation to IT-systems 
and software engineering methods as well as strategies for 
digitalization. Discussions stimulate a critical examination of the 
terms. Furthermore, lecturers from industry discuss current 
developments that are advancing the digitalization of their economic 
sector and provide practical examples. This includes domains such as 
automotive, automation, health, production or public Infrastructure.
