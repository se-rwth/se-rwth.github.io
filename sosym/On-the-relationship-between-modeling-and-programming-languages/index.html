<p>At the MODELS 2011 conference in New Zealand, Colin
Atkinson, held a panel on “When will Code become
Irrelevant?”. The panelists were requested to answer the
following six questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do you agree with the implied assumption in the panel
abstract that “code” is different to “models, at least in
the minds of practicing software engineers?</li>
  <li>If so, do you agree with the premise that code is still
the primary artifact, or at least still an important
artifact, in software engineering?</li>
  <li>If so, do you think it matters?</li>
  <li>If so, when if ever, will the situation change and what
will it take to make it happen?</li>
  <li>What can the research community do to help bring this
about?</li>
  <li>What will the future of modeling look like? Does modeling
have a future as an independent activity or will it fade
away in importance?</li>
</ol>

<p>Software developers create and use models for a variety of
purposes. For example, the following are three common forms
of uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Models as sketches: Developers find it useful to sketch
descriptions of requirements, design or deployment
concepts on whiteboards or paper when discussing their
ideas with other developers or customer representatives.
This use of models supports exploratory development of
concepts and ideas that may or may not later find their
way into more formal models or implementations.</li>
  <li>Models as analysis artifacts: Developers build analyzable
models to check specified properties (e.g., consistency
and satisfiability properties), to predict implementation
qualities (e.g., performance), or to simulate implemented
behavior. Included in this category of models are formal,
non-executable specifications that can be statically
analyzed, and executable models that support more dynamic
forms of analysis. These models typically contain only the
information needed to analyze target properties, and thus
may not include information that is needed to generate
full implementations.</li>
  <li>Models as the basis for code generation or synthesis of
software artifacts: Models can be built for the purpose of
generating implementations, test cases, deployment or
software configuration scripts, or other software
artifacts. These models must contain all necessary
information in a form that allow a generator to
mechanically synthesize software artifacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most important uses of modeling techniques and
languages is to build executable models. Executing a model
often involves code generation. From a practical standpoint
it makes a difference whether the developer’s intent is to
produce industrial-strength code when executing a model, or
to produce code that animates modeled behavior to provide
the developer with feedback on the adequacy of the model.,
One can expect that in the first case the generated code is
of better quality (e.g., more robust) than the code
generated for solely animation purposes. One can also
distinguish between code generation in which modeled
behavior is hardwired in the implemented system, and
generation of implementations that are configurable at
system initialization or even at runtime.</p>

<p>The constituents of an executable model are not necessarily
restricted to behavioral models such as Statecharts or
activity diagrams. Structural models, such as UML class
diagrams and composition structure diagrams can also
contribute to the execution of models. These models provide
information on the structures that are manipulated by
behaviors and thus their elements contribute to the
generation of data and information structures in
implementations.</p>

<p>Modeling languages that support the building of executable
models can be viewed as approximate forms of very high-level
programming languages, that is, languages above the current
high-level general-purpose programming languages (GPL).We
use the term “approximate forms” because we do not consider
that current modeling languages can completely replace or
mask out GPLs; there may be particular algorithmic elements
that probably cannot and should not be modeled in a more
abstract way than through statements in a GPL. The term
“very high-level” is used to reflect our view that models
are more abstract and compact than implementations expressed
in a GPL. For example, technical details (e.g., details
related to efficient implementations of complex data
structures) and domain-specific functionality can be added
through intelligent code generators and therefore need not
be present in the model used to generate the code.</p>

<p>If we look at today’s coding techniques, we can identify
quite a number of best practices that are based on
abstractions that are more conveniently represented in
design models. The state pattern (GOF 1993) provides one
such example. Extracting these abstractions from best
practices and incorporating them into modeling languages can
help promote the use of these best practices. Furthermore,
the explicit representation of these abstractions in
modeling languages makes it easier to maintain, evolve and
reuse the abstractions. The development of modeling
languages can thus benefit from an analysis of best coding
practices. Below we give our view on why this can be
challenging.</p>

<p>First, there is currently no successful tight integration
between modeling and programming technologies.Modeling tools
are typically heavy weight and not easily integrated with
others software development tools. They are heavyweight in
that they force developers to describe modeled elements in a
detailed form, before code generation can be performed.
Furthermore, developers often have to augment the generated
code with manually written code fragments, and thus they
need to read and understand the generated code in addition
to the original model. Another problem is that many tools do
not support automated synchronization of models and
generated code when changes occur in either the code or the
models. If developers manually modify generated parts of the
code, the lack of automated synchronization could result in
a loss of fidelity between the model and the code
implementation. This makes re-generation very difficult, if
not impossible. What we propose is needed are lightweight
approaches for the integration of models and implementations
expressed in a GPL that allows developers to manage both
models and GPL programs without directly viewing and
manipulating generated code. To our knowledge, current
tooling does not support this. While modern IDEs allow
developers to effectively manage source code, they do not
provide effective support for generating code from models,
primarily because they handle generated code in much the
same way as hand written code. This frequently leads to
problems with refactoring as well as versioning, and can
complicate the building process.</p>

<p>Another major problem that the modeling community currently
encounters is the lack of modularity. Good modularity allows
a developer to encapsulate strongly related design concepts
in a single code module (e.g., a procedure or class)
and to expose only the information needed by other modules
through an interface. This is the major driving force for
incremental compilation, reuse, use of code libraries,
dividing work amongst team members, and therefore provides
the means to scale development projects. With the exception
of Matlab/Simulink, today’s modeling languages do not
support the definition of an “interface” for a model. The
lack of interfaces leads to a different handling of models
during the development process. Tools typically load a
single large model in their workspace (we can be glad that
we have enough space to actually do this) and therefore
expose developers to all the details of the model. Any
change in the model, no matter how small, typically enforces
a complete regeneration. Models are thus monolithic entities
that expose all details to developers. This makes reuse of
models challenging and gets in the way of developing
libraries of reusable model fragments. As long as we are not
able to deal with models in a modular way, the cost of
developing and using models of complex systems may outweigh
the benefits of using the models in the development process.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of code management that can be
considered when developing effective model management
technologies, namely, differencing, merging, versioning,
management of variability and refactoring. In summary, we
feel there is a need to provide a tighter integration of
modeling and programming technologies if we are to see more
widespread use of modeling technologies in practice.</p>
