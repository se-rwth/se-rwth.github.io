      <p>(based on <a href="#GR19b">[GR19b]</a>)</p>

<p>It is said that in the times before Plato, mathematics was
only a vehicle to solve practical problems. Plato himself,
however, identified mathematics as a pure subject of
research, with the observation that the beauty of
mathematical theories was of deep intrinsic value to be
developed and refined independent of practical application.
This spawned mathematics as a field of research, which also
led to many more practical applications as a result.</p>

<p>Computer science has a much younger history. Some early
approaches to general-purpose programming (e.g., Charles
Babbage’s mechanical general-purpose computer in the 1800s,
the Analytical Engine, and Ada Lovelace’s first algorithms)
are the most well-known examples. However, computer
science (or better: informatics) really emerged in the
twentieth century. Informatics started as a tool to help
with other science and mathematics investigations. When the
increasing complexity became clear, informatics became the
target of its own research area with beautiful results in
various subdomains.</p>

<p>Modeling, however, is much older. Conceptual models are
omnipresent in philosophy, physics, chemistry, and many
other inquiry-based disciplines. Physical manifestations of
models were used frequently in building construction. The
term “model” had an early historical connection to the
construction of churches, where a model was a 1:10 reduced
wooden version of the church to be built. From the great
inventor Da Vinci, we still have many drawings that model
surprising and smart machines—even though many of them have
never been built. We, however,
are not aware of the topic of modeling as its own subject or
research area in these earlier centuries.</p>

<p>The concept of a model needed more formalization when a
specific semantics was required, such as modeling of systems
and software. The most widely used definition of “model” was
coined by Stachowiak only in 1973. Programming theory and
semantics definitions needed a precisely defined notion of a
well-formed piece of code. This notion also carried over to
other forms of digitally communicated models. This includes
Petri Nets in their various forms, automata and statecharts,
class diagrams, action languages, and other forms of
modeling languages. The formal methods domain (including
logic) and the programming language domain (in particular,
compiler construction) in informatics were the earliest to
put some focus on the value of models and explicitly defined
modeling languages. Software engineers and database
administrators also relied upon models in various
representations, focusing on the practical use of restricted
forms of models. Interestingly, modeling tools have been a
core product offered by commercial vendors since the
beginning of the software industry. In fact, the first
software product sold independently of a hardware package
was Autofow, which was a flowchart modeling tool developed in
1964 by Martin Goetz of Applied Data Research.</p>

<p>The use of models was widely discussed in the software
engineering domain during the 1980s and 1990s, where a
variety of different modeling languages (e.g., Booch’s clouds
and Rumbaugh’s object models) were adopted. Around 1994, the
overlap of common concepts across the various modeling
languages pointed to the need for a unification of the
different languages. The “methods wars”, which were intensely
discussed at the OOPSLA conferences during the 1990s, were
finally resolved into a standardization effort, first called
the “Unified Method” and later leading to the “Unified
Modeling Language” (UML). During this crucial period of
unification, it became clear that defining such a standard
would not be an easy task. A research community emerged that
became interested in studying models and the UML as a core
research subject area of its own.</p>

<p>In 1998, Jean Bézivin and Pierre-Alain Muller organized the
first UML workshop, “The Unified Modeling Language. «UML»’98:
Beyond the Notation” in Mulhouse, France, June 3–4, 1998.
Based on the success of the scientific event and the obvious
need for further discussion and investigation, Robert France
and Bernhard Rumpe (the founding creators of SoSyM; after
Jean Bézivin came up with the idea)
organized the follow-up event “UML 99—The Unified Modeling
Language”. Beyond the Standard” as the first international
conference specific to software modeling, held in Fort
Collins, Colorado (USA) in October 28–30, 1999. Some general
questions that were discussed during this nascent period of
modeling research included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is a good UML modeling language?</li>
  <li>Concentration on core modeling constructs or elaborate
comfort within UML?</li>
  <li>How to integrate orthogonal sublanguages?</li>
  <li>Semantics of UML sublanguages?</li>
  <li>How to compose, refine, and translate UML models?</li>
  <li>How to build reliable tooling for the UML with degrees of
automation?</li>
  <li>How to teach UML?</li>
  <li>What are appropriate methods that use UML?</li>
  <li>How to use UML for variability modeling, components, or
frameworks?</li>
  <li>How to positively improve the standard definition?</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2005, the UML series of conferences was broadened to the
general question of what defines a good modeling language.
The focus remained on the development of software, but
because software usually is embedded in a social, technical,
or business context, various domains inside and related to
informatics were more deeply involved. Therefore, the 2005
edition of the conference was renamed to “Model Driven
Engineering Languages and Systems” using the acronym
“MoDELS/UML” and held in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in October</p>
<ol>
  <li>The above questions were discussed not only for the
UML standard, which had at that time become relatively
stable (and incomplete in terms of practical adoption, with
many existing UML tools only partially satisfying many of
the users needs). The MODELS conference name change also
recognized the emergence of domain-specific modeling
languages (DSMLs) that were not specifically tied to the UML.
The increased interest in DSMLs helped to add a new research
focus on language definition and semantics, as well as the
usage and engineering of such languages
(e.g., for testing, code synthesis, simulation, and artifact
transformation).</li>
</ol>

<p>Many recent publications use modeling as a contribution to a
specific application domain, but much of the modeling
research literature also concentrates on modeling languages
as a core subject of study (rather than just a vehicle to
study something else). As a consequence, many new
conferences over the past decade have emerged that are
centered around modeling themes, which have been hosted by
SoSyM as special issues (e.g., ECMFA, ICMT, and the DSM
workshop series). We can safely state that since the early
UML discussions at OOPSLA in the 1990s and the start of the
MoDELS/UML series of conferences, models and modeling
languages have become the subject of study of research on
their own, leading to hundreds of Ph.D. dissertations across
the world. An emerging focus has been to transfer the
research results into practice by building
industrial-strength and robust commercial modeling tools.</p>

<p>It is equally important to understand what models, denoted
in explicit and purposeful modeling languages, can do for
engineers or scientists beyond pure software development. It
is time to understand how the digital models of informatics
can be merged with the continuous calculus of control
theory, the geometric models of mechanical engineering, and
how to use behavioral modeling with uncertainty,
underspecification, variants, and high-configurability of
models at runtime. Physical and chemical laws can be
understood as models of the world, and software controlling
some part of it needs an integrated understanding.</p>

<p>With only a few decades of existence, there is much for the
modeling research community to do. This is why we expect
SoSyM to grow further and to become and remain the primary
venue of articles focusing on modeling and modeling
languages—on a more formal, as well as applied with a
technological focus.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Models are both, a vehicle and a subject of study.</li>
  <li>They are a vehicle for engineering to develop systems
(including software systems)
as well as for science to understand and analyse the world.</li>
  <li>Their complexity also makes them subject of study:
which construction, synthesis, composition,
analysis and transformation techniques
are possible and how to constrain or empower expressiveness
for those techniques.</li>
