      <p>The use of models and the activity of 
modeling is an integral part of almost all development activities for 
complex systems.</p>

<h5 id="complexity---the-main-challenge"><strong><em>Complexity - the main Challenge</em></strong></h5>

<p><strong>Complexity is an omnipresent challenge, for software, 
for mechanical systems with intelligence</strong> (e.g., autonomous cars, 
robots, healthcare gadgets or airplanes)<strong>, for production plants, and 
also for biological systems</strong> (e.g., advanced medicine, human cells, 
organs, and even full organisms), that will be engineered with 
increased frequency in the future. Managing complexity in a development 
process becomes much easier, when a well organized development process
can be centered around an end-to-end modelling approach, allowing to 
connect early requirements, architectural and design decisions, 
behavioral specifications, as well as testable expected properties and
test data through an integrated modeling approach.</p>

<p><strong>“Systems of systems”</strong> are typically 
confederated and collaborating ensembles of systems that were 
originally designed individually, but through new opportunities that 
were not originally envisioned, are now required to tightly cooperate. 
Examples of such systems include telecommunications services, multiple 
integrated web services across the internet, energy networks and also 
the city networks of collaborating smart buildings and transportation 
infrastructure. Modelling is a core technique to understand the 
interplay of a system of systems.</p>

<h5 id="models-in-engineering"><strong><em>Models in Engineering</em></strong></h5>

<p>All of the examples listed previously rely on models. During development 
of these initially independent systems, models are often defined before 
the system exists, requiring explicit modeling activities to explicate 
requirements on the system to document multiple design decisions and 
alternatives.</p>

<h5 id="models-in-data-science"><strong><em>Models in Data Science</em></strong></h5>

<p>This is an entirely different process from how models 
come to life when using data science techniques to extract models 
(e.g., of behavior or typical dynamic configurations) from observations 
of existing systems. These other kinds of extracted models are helpful 
when optimizing existing systems and processes, but are not intended 
for the original design (which may have occurred by nature).</p>

<h5 id="shared-modeling-paradigms"><strong><em>Shared Modeling Paradigms?</em></strong></h5>

<p>However, 
it is our belief that even though the process for model creation and 
use is different across various domains, the same underlying modeling 
paradigms and concepts can often be incorporated. As a consequence, 
these models could also be adopted in similar modeling languages.</p>

<p>This brings us to the interesting question of <strong>whether and how far a 
modeling language from UML or SysML (e.g., Statecharts or Activity 
Diagrams) is already fit for this purpose?</strong></p>

<p>For example, <strong>how much 
extension</strong> is needed to add concepts such as <strong>modeling uncertainty and 
statistical distribution of possible behaviors</strong>? Even though there is 
much research in these domains that has produced compelling results, 
how long will it take to see these results made available in broadly 
used tools? We believe that much progress still needs to be made in 
order to realize the full potential.</p>

<h5 id="software-model-languages-migrate-to-systems-engineering"><strong><em>Software Model Languages migrate to Systems Engineering?</em></strong></h5>

<p>Currently (in 2022+), there is an ongoing effort to inject more 
explicit modeling techniques into the Systems Engineering discipline, 
which we define as including the intersection of the mechanical, 
electrical and software subdomains.</p>

<p>Software Engineering already 
provides many modeling techniques to address complexity and 
architectural structure. This is also true for Electrical Engineering, 
with Mechanical Engineering supporting the use of many modeling ideas 
in different contexts.</p>

<p>The concepts of modeling across these 
disciplines can expand the ability of a systems engineer to address 
safety, security, robustness and operability concerns, as well as many 
other desirable properties of the systems to be developed and produced 
in the future.</p>

<h5 id="model-and-language-integration"><strong><em>Model and Language Integration</em></strong></h5>

<p>This observation brings us to the well-known challenge that most of 
these modeling techniques do not integrate very well. As a consequence, 
it is still frustratingly difficult to define an appropriate tool chain 
that adequately addresses a new project’s needs (e.g., systems analyses 
and synthesis activities).</p>

</p>

<h5 id="ai-components-in-a-system-a-game-changer--partially"><strong><em>AI-components in a System: a game changer? – Partially!</em></strong></h5>

<p>From a Software Engineering point of view, the existence of components 
developed using Artificial Intelligence does not really change the 
game. Software Engineering has established the foundational 
understanding that software is never completely correct and the 
unpredictable behavioral errors must be detected and absorbed 
internally to prevent full system failure. The integration of AI 
components becomes just another type of unreliable component that must 
be mastered.</p>

<p>Specific precautions must be taken to address the 
possible failures of AI-based components. Even the idea of 
self-explainability is not an entirely new concept. A common challenge 
of Software Engineering is the need to explain to a user what the 
software is doing or why it cannot do a specific requested action. The 
existence of explicitly defined models can be helpful in explaining 
behavior to users (e.g., using state model as underlying concepts).</p>

<h5 id="advanced-systems-engineering-needs-both-software-engineering-and-ai"><strong><em>“Advanced Systems Engineering” needs both, Software Engineering and AI</em></strong></h5>

<p>The idea of “Advanced Systems Engineering” is an approach that tries to 
address many of the current challenges, often by adding AI-based 
development techniques for the software needs of the system.</p>

<p>However, 
many of the existing modeling techniques, methods and practices of 
Software Engineering are currently often ignored because of an 
assumption that 
software need not be developed in the future as in the past. This 
approach places an emphasis on training software through condensing 
available data to directly embeddable models. Yet, this idea will only 
work in very very narrow cases and it is not clear what to do with the 
majority of the complex software that is not addressed by an “Advanced 
Systems Engineering” approach.</p>

<p>Innovative systems seem to derive their 
innovations to a larger extent from the software and software services 
around the mechanical part of the system. 
And only a little part of it can actually be developed using AI techniques.
The rest is still pure Software Engineering.</p>

<h5 id="software-engineering-methods-techniques-and-tools-would-be-well-applied-in-other-disciplines"><strong><em>Software Engineering methods, techniques and tools would be well applied in other disciplines</em></strong></h5>

<p>Computer Science (in general) and Software Engineering (in particular) 
have not been able to transfer all of their knowledge, techniques and 
methods to Systems Engineering.</p>

<p>There is much to do and the use of an 
integrated set of modeling techniques, defined in explicit modeling 
languages and assisted by an integrated toolchain, is still far away. 
Software development methods, such as Agile Methods or DevOps, amidst 
the general use of models is steadily increasing in the integrated 
Systems Engineering domain.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see which forms of model modularity will be 
more successful and beneficial for Systems Engineers in the long-term 
and how all of these forms and their use of models will collaborate 
during design and operation of advanced, intelligent systems.</p>

<h5 id="some-achievements-of-software-engineering"><strong><em>Some Achievements of Software Engineering</em></strong></h5>

<p>The above observations are to be seen in the light of the history and 
start of the Software Engineering discipline: In early times software 
engineers were often told from experts in systems development that they 
“should develop their software in the same systematic and predictable 
way as other engineers (e.g., mechanical engineers)”.</p>

<p>We can trace Software Engineering back to the 1968 NATO Science 
Committee conference in Garmisch, Germany, organized by Friedrich L. 
Bauer. In that short time, software developers have created their own 
portfolio of methods, ranging from heavyweight documentation-oriented 
approaches to the much more beloved agile and light-weight methods. 
Even though there is always potential for optimization, agile 
techniques have reached a level where software developers can produce 
reliable products using cost efficient, relatively predictable and 
controllable processes.</p>

<p>What seems to be even more important is that the way of developing 
software is tightly connected to general innovation processes that not 
only lead to novel ideas about how to implement software, but also to 
new ideas about potential features and services that can be integrated 
into software solutions. The tight coupling of software development and 
innovation is closely related to the strong connection between 
requirements elicitation and direct implementation in agile processes, 
where the same stakeholders are responsible for the innovations of 
development. Furthermore, the invention of new control and data 
structures in object-oriented development can drive the innovation of 
new features.</p>

<p>Software-based companies in Silicon Valley have used this mood of 
innovation effectively. They have integrated software services into 
their core business model, which has led to innovative thinking and 
effective, agile development of products in other domains (e.g., 
medical services, autonomous driving, electric cars, finance). 
Traditional companies based on fundamental engineering processes may 
feel threatened by the radical change and fast rate of innovation that 
the new technologies offer.</p>

<p>There are many challenges in training classical engineers to adopt a 
new form of project organization, most importantly more<br>
responsibilities are given to the developers and developers have to 
accept these. However, this mindset is a constructive approach to 
improve innovation. Traditional engineering-based companies, as well as 
other software-intensive companies, now have to catch up. Many good 
examples in these areas give us hope that change is possible.</p>

<p>In systems that require expertise from multiple areas of engineering, 
traditional engineers are becoming more open to software engineering 
practices. Furthermore, software development methodologies are being 
adopted more frequently into traditional engineering practice. In a 
recent and wellknown German TV broadcast, a highly esteemed expert in 
mechanical and production engineering, Günther Schuh, was asked why he 
and his team were able to produce the “StreetScooter” electric car so 
quickly. Schuh said, “Because they have used computer science methods”. 
In particular, Schuh mentioned agility as a key catalyst to the 
increased speed of development.</p>
