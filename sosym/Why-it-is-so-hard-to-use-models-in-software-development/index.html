      <p>(based on <a href="#FRS13">[FRS13]</a>)</p>

<p>In a previous SoSyM editorial, we asked what modeling contributes
to the development process. We concluded that models are not
so much of value for themselves, but exist to improve
certain properties of the product, such as quality or
maintainability, or of the process, such as cost-efficiency
and predictability.</p>

<p>In this essay, we would like to report on specific
findings that are based on the reported and own experience
with some concrete modeling tools and frameworks of
different types (without naming them) and draw some
conclusions for further tool improvement.</p>

<p>The basic idea is simple: create a model in a source
language (e.g., a class diagram or a state machine), take a
code generator, and generate the code for it in a target
language. The idea behind is that the model is much simpler
and thus easier to write and assess than the resulting code.
Some of the reasons are that a model can abstract from the
implementation details as well as from the technological
platform as well as from unnecessary details of the
application domain. We can “measure” this by comparing the
size of the model with that of the resulting code. And this
indeed works and helps.</p>

<p>But there are a lot of practical problems. Let us classify
and briefly discuss some of them:</p>

<h4 id="measurement-of-speedup"><em>Measurement of speedup:</em></h4>

<p>Comparing LOC of the generated code
with the number of syntactic concepts (or something similar)
used in a model is not easy: the size of the generated code
can be impressive. But how much of it do we actually use?
How much would we actually write, if written by hand? How
much effort goes into the development or adaptation of the
generator? How much more familiar are we with the target
language compared to the modeling language and the code
generator? Do we know a good metrics for speedup through the
use of modeling tools? Does speedup only occur in similar
follow-up projects?</p>

<h4 id="integration-of-generated-and-handwritten-code"><em>Integration of generated and handwritten code:</em></h4>

<p>One-shot
generators allow us to modify the generated code. This is
typical for code frames derived from class diagrams. Better
tools try mapping back and forth using round-trip
engineering. This, however, seems to work to a very limited
extend only, especially when the conceptual distance between
the languages is small and appears to be somewhat brittle if
unexpected modifications occur. A third approach is to not
expose the generated code to the developer. While this is
similar to the compiler approach, where assembler code is
not seen any more today, this approach does not work yet:
first, handwritten code usually must know about the
generated code. So developers have to inspect at least parts
of the generated code. This code inspection could be reduced
by generating “interfaces” for all APIs to be available and
to describe the generated code by some JavaDoc-like
mechanism. Second generation becomes useful when the
generator knows something about the technology stack being
used. It ideally encapsulates this stack such that the
normal developer does not have to know about it anymore.
This requires the generation process often to be adapted by
certain key developers that thus need to be able to
understand the generated code.</p>

<h4 id="selection-of-the-target-language-and-their-concepts"><em>Selection of the target language and their concepts:</em></h4>

<p>The
more elaborate the target language and its frameworks, the
better. Generating Java is much easier than generating
Assembler. But how many concepts should be used? Using
visibilities, type infrastructure or even generics in the
target code can become a nightmare when some concepts of the
source language, such as dynamic extension of the attribute
section or type adaptation, do not fit. Encoding these
concepts can become tough when the underlying infrastructure
should be retained. This is why some generators use
reflection when targeting Java: this is easier and more
systematic for the generator, but lacks understandability.
If the generated code is invisible for the developer, it
need not obey any coding guidelines. If the generated code
is “correct by generation” anyway, it need not deal with
encapsulation (visibility) issues or the underlying typing
system at all. It could directly create untyped, generic
code or use reflection when needed, quite like assembler,
and may be mimic its own typing structure. But what if the
code is not correct or the generator needs to be adapted?</p>

<h4 id="modularity-of-the-generated-code"><em>Modularity of the generated code:</em></h4>

<p>Encapsulation of the
generated code is necessary to prevent the developer having
to inspect it (at least if he/she is only using it) and
allows us to repeatedly generate if the model changes. We
discussed this in detail in the essay in issue 12–3
because we feel this is a very important and for modeling
languages still not a very well-understood concept.</p>

<h4 id="architecture-of-the-system"><em>Architecture of the System:</em></h4>

<p>Let us assume that generated
code remains unchanged. How do we organize the system:
traditionally, systems are defined in subsystems sharing
common data structures and communication and are well
structured in packages. Furthermore, architectural styles
such as the layer architectures allow us to organize the
application core independently of any GUI and the
persistence. Keeping the architecture clean when using code
generation seems to require a lot of discipline. But is this
still an appropriate architecture or do we need to come up
with a different approach? Please note, we discuss the
dynamic object architecture at runtime, the class
dependencies at compile and generation time as well as the
package structure. The last two directly relate to the
question, whether handwritten code can depend on generated
code and vice versa.</p>

<h4 id="generic-versus-generative-codes"><em>Generic versus generative codes:</em></h4>

<p>Developers tend to avoid
generating clean and powerful solutions but to introduce
generic, handwritten solutions instead. Introducing a
generation process is generally more work than just coding a
generic solution. With today’s languages—here, we refer,
e.g., to Java—generic solutions often become quite handy.
Mechanisms, like subtyping polymorphism, generics, and
powerful and dangerous reflection, allow developers to do
quite efficient things, with simple concepts like design
patterns up to Web frameworks with reflective examinations
of plain old Java objects (POJOs). When the languages,
frameworks, and tooling infrastructures become ever more
generic, do we then need generation at all? The state
pattern is a direct explicit representation of automata in
code. Is it readable and can we omit generating code from
state machines? Can we explicitly encode more modeling
languages?</p>

<h4 id="how-to-organize-the-development-process-methodical-part"><em>How to organize the development process (methodical part):</em></h4>

<p>The classic activities of software development need to be
rethought if the coding activity does not happen anymore.
How do we ensure quality? What needs to be tested? What are
testing metrics? Ideally, the “executable” model replaces
the source code roles and should therefore be used as target
for quality assurance. Instead, our testing techniques
mainly focus on the code and therefore test developers (a)
have to understand the generated code and (b) much more
tests are necessary to cover the generated code than to
“cover” the source model. However, this is necessary anyway,
if the generator is adaptive (see above).</p>

<h4 id="how-to-organize-the-development-process-technical-part-1-automation"><em>How to organize the development process (technical part 1: automation):</em></h4>

<p>Automation is the key for speeding up the
development process. First, to be able to repeatedly execute
the generation, the generation process needs to be fully
automated, e.g., through a script, an Ant configuration, or
a traditional makefile. While those scripts nicely
cooperate, e.g., with C compilers, modern languages like
Java come with semi-intelligent compilers that handle
dependency management on their own. This collides with
dependency management for source generation. Furthermore,
there is neither a logical rule nor an explicit connection
between the model and their resulting generated artifacts 
(which can be seen only by examining the code generator).
Therefore, it is not externally derivable what needs to be
generated again when parts of the models change. Thus,
efficient scripts are much harder or even impossible to
write. In practice, this leads to heavy and complete
regeneration or a generation that needs to be controlled
manually instead of a regeneration on demand only. The first
seriously slows down the development. The second is very
error-prone, as people tend to forget some manual generation
steps.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-organize-the-development-process-technical-part-2-dependencies"><em>How to organize the development process (technical part 2: dependencies):</em></h4>

<p>Another problem is that the dependencies are
not only to be maintained for the generation of files, but
also for temporary cleanups. A full cleanup of all generated
classes in each generation step completely spoils agile
development speed. Dependency management needs to be part of
a generator. This must also work, e.g., in scenarios, where
many classes are generated from a class diagram. When a
class description is removed from the diagram, the
regeneration needs to remove the old (generated) class too,
but the diagram itself does not contain any information
about the old class anymore. Thus, dependency management
needs to be intelligent and needs to orchestrate all
generation and compilation processes.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-organize-the-development-process-technical-part-3-version-control"><em>How to organize the development process (technical part 3: version control):</em></h4>

<p>Do not put generated files under version
control! When you want all developers to be able to
regenerate, then conflicts on files generated under version
control cannot be avoided. One solution could be to put the
generator under version control or offer it as commonly and
automatically usable Web service such that each developer is
able to regenerate locally and generated files need not be
version controlled. A second best solution is that only one
developer is allowed to regenerate. This seriously
complicates the development, when all developers are allowed
to adapt the models. We also saw an alternative, where the
generation process is done through the version control
system: (1) check in the source model, (2) a demon in the
back does the generation, and (3) if successful (4), the
generated code is checked in, too. That also is a misuse of
the version control as it affects other developers before
the code is being cleared. So, not putting generated code
under version control is the only useful possibility in
team-oriented development projects.</p>

<h4 id="generation-using-templates-yet-another-language"><em>Generation using templates: yet another language:</em></h4>

<p>In order
to make generation adaptable, template languages such as
FreeMarker seem to be the appropriate tool. This introduces
a third language to be dealt with. Developers now need to
master models, target language, and FreeMarker templates.
Templates to some extent look like the target with
extensions. FreeMarker uses callbacks to Java. Java also has
to provide the underlying metamodel (abstract syntax) of the
model. The template language also needs control elements 
(loops, if-then-else, template inclusions) as well as
handling of the data (typically strings, lists, maps).
FreeMarker would allow complex computations, but they should
not be written there to keep templates and therefore the
code generator readable and understandable. Instead, these
computations should be provided by the underlying metamodel.
This enforces the developer to become a tool smith and also
define some Java code for the metamodel. But is there a
simpler yet powerful alternative to templates or similar
scripting languages when generating source code?</p>

<h4 id="organizing-templates"><em>Organizing templates:</em></h4>

<p>The metamodel, extra Java
functionality on top of the metamodel, and the templates
exhibit a complex interplay that has to be mastered.
Templates easily become rather complex, in particular when
alternative cases or iterations need to be handled. Thus,
templates need to be structured into hierarchies of
subtemplates. Accordingly, the interplay between templates
and the Java-based metamodel becomes complex. A plug-in
mechanism to integrate calculations is also necessary to
allow such adaptive definitions. This introduces lots of
Java and template files and hence asks for a precise
management and documentation of the templates and plug-in
calculations.</p>

<p>The organization of templates needs to cope with several
dimensions: (a) a template operates on one node of the
metamodel of a certain type. (b) The result may be a
complete file or a part to be included in another file. (c)
The generated artifacts must conform to some concept (e.g.,
a nonterminal or metamodel class) of the target language,
e.g., a subtemplate can generate a complete class file, but
can also produce a statement, a block, an expression, an
attribute or method definition, an import statement, a
package, or a list of those.
(d) Finally, subtemplates often assume context information
to be given, e.g., an expression template expects certain
variables. How to manage knowledge about template and their
purposes?</p>

<p>Finally, there definitively is demand for a library of such
templates and plug-ins.</p>

<h4 id="quality-management-for-templates"><em>Quality management for templates:</em></h4>

<p>Assuming, we have an
adaptive development process: how do we keep the quality
management simple? Some FreeMarker-based projects
demonstrate the complex structure of templates as discussed
above. Template engines like FreeMarker do not know anything
about their target language and can, thus, produce
syntactical nonsense. Control structures in templates make
it undecidable whether this can happen. Therefore, the
correctness of the generated result is checked after
generation by the compiler, which all too often finds
illegal syntax, missing variables, or methods, etc., in the
generated code. This is too late and does not help to speed
up the development. Furthermore, tracing erroneous code back
to the originating template and template configuration is
complex. “Debugging templates” in the generation process
could help when adapting templates.</p>

<h4 id="organizing-generator-libraries"><em>Organizing generator libraries:</em></h4>

<p>We need various libraries of
complete or extensible generators for specific target
platforms, technologies, and purposes. But how do components
of such a generator library look like? How do extension
mechanisms look like? Which documentation and set of
configuration parameters is needed for each generator to be
easily reusable and adaptable for different software
projects? And finally, a combination of generators could be
used for one software project as well.</p>

<h4 id="testing-or-debugging-generated-code"><em>Testing (or debugging) generated code:</em></h4>

<p>If the generation
process was successful, debugging of the product is another
important issue. If the error is identified and comes from
the generated code: how can it be traced back to the
template or the model source? Modularity of the generated
code could help a lot here. Furthermore, it is always better
to run automated tests than to trace manually using
debuggers. Model-based debuggers are widely missing. It is a
good approach to test the generator and its templates on a
well-defined but small set of source models before using it
on real project models. Automatic tests can then be reused
when adapting the generator. Another set of tests can be
used for the generated application, assuming that the
generated code is already unit-tested and only integration
tests are necessary. And by the way, tests can be generated
too, using appropriate test models (different from the
source models).</p>

<h4 id="integrated-development-environment-ide"><em>Integrated development environment (IDE):</em></h4>

<p>IDEs such as
Eclipse provide a tremendous amount of comfort to the
developers. Editors can make use of highlighting,
auto-completion, quick navigation to definitions of
methods/classes used, etc. Compilation is done automatically
and incrementally in the background. Refactoring steps
simplify larger restructurings as well as consistent
renaming operations. Programming language infrastructures
like for Java are very well elaborated with their typing,
visibility, and import mechanisms to control dependencies.
All this is widely missing for modeling languages, making
model-based development much more tedious. Eclipse in
particular does not know the difference between a generated
and a handwritten Java class, and therefore, searching
facilities do find a great number of code that could
otherwise be hidden. Refactoring does not apply to source
models but to the generated code, thus enforcing the
modelers to adapt their models manually. Even worse, using
the automatic refactoring support of current IDEs will
change the generated code without notifying the developer
who might not be aware of the necessary manual adaption of
the models. In this case, the next generator run will
override the refactoring, which leads to compile errors in
the generated code. Integrated model/code management would
allow refactoring beyond language borders. The same would
hold for auto-completion that allows developers to include
elements from the source models in other source models as
well as handwritten code and vice versa. This would also
prevent many errors coming from the missing generated code
at the beginning or after cleanup.</p>

<p>It would already help, if Eclipse knew the difference
between handwritten source and generated code. Currently,
when a generation run takes place, the developer manually
has to tell Eclipse that code has changed (Refresh). Eclipse
should also relax its warnings on generated code, as it is
common to add potential imports, methods, or variables that
are not used in the code in certain configurations.</p>

<p>Agile development only became possible when the appropriate
tooling based on modern languages became available. Modeling
tools still miss this agility for a variety of reasons
discussed above. Some of these problems come from the
man-made situation that IDEs currently assume a solely
code-based development process, not at all allowing the
integration with modeling tools. This sometimes leads to the
invention of tooling workarounds, which in the long run only
creates more problems.</p>

<p>However, many of the above-mentioned problems only seem to
be pragmatic at first sight, but looking deeper into them,
most of them require a very deep and precise theoretical
solution that needs to be conceptually developed by
researchers.</p>

<p>If you know solutions for some of these problems, please
send your paper explaining it to SoSyM or tell us directly.
If you experience similar or completely different problems,
please also drop us a note (e.g., rumpe@se-rwth.de).</p>
