      <p>(based on <a href="#FR13a">[FR13a]</a>)</p>

<p>In 2007 ICSE hosted a track called “Future of Software
Development” (FOSD). We were invited to write and present a
paper on the future of modeling for the track. The resulting
paper <a href="#FR07">[FR07]</a> described the state of modeling research,
identified some major challenges and proposed a research
road map. Parts of this road map are currently being
explored, and progress has been made in addressing some of
the challenges we identified. However, there is still
significant research “to be done” with respect to the
challenges outlined in that paper. It is not our intent to
discuss the progress the community has made with respect to
the road map in this essay (our apologies for deflating
expectations in this regard; an essay is simply not the
place for such discussions). Rather, we would like to use
this essay to stimulate discussions around some of the
challenges that have arisen since we wrote that paper.</p>

<p>Before we get into identifying specific challenges, let us
first take a step back and ask “What is the grand challenge
addressed by researchers in the SoSyM community?” The answer
has typically been “To significantly reduce the time, cost,
and effort required to develop complex software-intensive
systems that meet stringent quality requirements through use
of models that are fit-for-purpose.” This is still the focus
of many research programs, but we are also seeing a
broadening of the grand challenge to include not only
development problems, but problems that occur throughout the
lifetime of a complex system, from conception to retirement.
For example, in the FOSD paper <a href="#FR07">[FR07]</a>
we made reference to emerging
work on the use of models to manage software at runtime (now
referred to as models@run.time). The grand challenge is thus
evolving to encompass a wider range of problems that occur
in the life cycle of complex systems, as it should. It is
interesting to note that in other disciplines the use of
models to manage work on artifacts throughout their life
cycles is receiving significant attention. For example, in
the construction domain building information modeling (BIM),
techniques and standards are being developed to support the
management to built environments from conception, to
architectural design, to onsite construction, to building
occupancy and finally to building demolition. In this case
models are the primary means for managing work throughout a
building’s lifetime.</p>

<p>Given this broader view of the role that models can play, we
have identified the following research opportunities and
challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Systems that integrate mechanical, software and electrical
engineering subsystems (e.g., cyber-physical systems
(CPS)) will become commonplace, and thus, there is a need
for work on how the modeling approaches used by experts in
these diverse domains can be integrated. This is a very
challenging problem, and thus, there is a need for
significant intellectual investment in developing
integrated modeling languages and associated tooling. With
respect to CPS, there are two core issues that require our
attention as researchers:
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanical, electrical and software engineering rely on
entirely different theories (e.g., theories based on
continuous mathematics versus those based on event-based
automata), and thus engineers in these domains use very
different approaches. The challenge is to develop good
bridges across these theories.</li>
      <li>Proper integration of two very different development
processes is needed. The development processes should be
decoupled to the extent possible, for example, if
software is the dominating factor (and risk), software
development should not be made dependent on the
mechanical development process. Currently, this is
sometimes not possible because software developers
usually need the mechanical parts (physical or
electrical) to exist before starting development. What
can help in this respect is a front-loading process that
disconnects software and mechanical development through
the use of models of the mechanical systems to
facilitate early simulations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Virtual construction and testing through simulation will
become increasingly important. Simulating the context of a
system or subsystem to understand its behavior is
particularly important (where the context may include, or
exclude, mechanical parts). This might require extensive
understanding of the context, which can be facilitated by
models.</li>
  <li>Tooling for advanced artifact management including
information and dependency tracing, variability modeling,
advanced consistency checking and analysis will have to
improve, possibly by orders of magnitude, to better
support effective use of models across a system’s
lifetime.</li>
  <li>Models are more effective if they are properly integrated
into a system’s life cycle processes. In particular,
system development processes have a high degree of
potential innovation, and thus, these processes need to be
adaptable to project, product and developer’s needs. At
the same time, they must also be controlled in a
predictable manner. Explicit modeling of the processes, as
is done for business processes, is needed if we want to
tightly integrate processes with models.</li>
  <li>Adaptive systems that require new levels of security and
safety are beginning to emerge. For example, dynamic
adaptation or updating is necessary because customization
by users demands not only system flexibility, but also
frequent security updates. Apps from smartphones and
software plugins are manifestations of this adaptability.
Even their versioning is independent of the underlying
technologies. Explicit use of models during runtime to
allow customer adaptation could prove to be beneficial.
Safety and security issues could call for modeling the
possible bandwidth of customization through appropriate
constraint specification languages that are inherently
underspecified.</li>
  <li>Cloud systems will soon be integrated with non-cloudbased
systems, e.g., for storage and handling of masses of
sensor data of various sources (car, home, body, factory,
energy, city, state and governance), and will have an
impact on systems that connect to the Internet (“Internet
of things”). There is thus a need to investigate ways in
which cloud-based concerns can be addressed in models.</li>
  <li>Multicore may play increasingly important roles in
embedded systems, e.g., to provide redundancy on chips
(for safety reasons) and support reliable parallel
computations at least of parts of the software. Can
modeling help here, e.g., by explicitly orchestrating
parallelization, redundancy and security levels?</li>
  <li>“Correctness by construction” will become even more
feasible. A prominent example is the use of a
deterministic, real-time bus for the implementation of
communication, such that models that include time
constraints can faithfully be mapped to the implementation
and by construction communication scheduling fits the
desired needs. A second example is the use of an
executable DSL
(or programming language) again with explicit time
constraints combined with a restricted expressivity for
loops and recursion for both data structure and
functionality. This allows generators to predict
worst-case computation times of the generated program and
thus automated checking of reliability of specified timing
constraints. Fortunately, these techniques help engineers
tackle new problems, e.g., by means of the above-mentioned
multicore and CPS technologies. Combinations of frameworks
and hardware technology with models to customize them will
certainly be of help here. We expect more techniques to
solve problems by construction instead of postmortem
analysis to come in the increasingly critical security and
safety systems domain.</li>
  <li>Formal methods reloaded in lightweight forms provide “just
enough” analysis to meet development needs in many
situations. These techniques are typically model-based,
e.g., Sat-Solvers and Model Checking, and they provide
developers with feedback expressed in familiar languages.
We anticipate that further advanced forms of automatic
analysis and, in particular, constructive synthesis will
come. Some of them are the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Automatic synthesis of complete models from views.</li>
      <li>Automatic mappings of logical models to a distributed
hardware architecture according to functionality needs
and reliability.</li>
      <li>Automated correctness checking of certain kinds of
algorithms.</li>
      <li>Generation of proof obligations along with execution of
refactorings (behavior-preserving transformations) on
models and ideally automated proofs.</li>
      <li>Automated checking of consistency of a set of selected
model elements to a configuration in a software product
line.</li>
      <li>Automated checking of conformance of behavior of a
subclass/subcomponent implementation versus the
super-specification it replaces.</li>
      <li>Proof that decomposition of a more complex functionality
into time-consuming subsystems in total still serves the
desired quality of service.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The community still lacks tool infrastructures that enable
agile model-based development. These infrastructures will
allow us to use DSLs in more agile ways. However, the
challenging question is “Who is going to provide the
tooling for these DSLs?”</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, there are still significant challenges that we
need to address. We hope to see more submitted papers that
go beyond the traditional modeling boundaries.</p>
