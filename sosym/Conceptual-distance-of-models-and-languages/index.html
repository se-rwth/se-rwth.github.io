<p>Conceptual distance (i.e., measurement of the distance
between two sets of concepts) had its roots in linguistics
as the semantic distance problem. In the linguistics
context, conceptual distance provides a metric of the
difficulty in understanding a topic across different
disciplines or subject areas. However, it seems that there
is no commonly agreed and well-founded theory that allows
measurement of the distance between two sets of concepts. We
believe that it is worthwhile to measure the conceptual
distance between models, and also between languages.</p>

<p>In the domain of conceptual modeling, which emerged from
entity–relationship modeling, models are usually explicit,
describing the concepts (e.g., classes in OO), their
properties (e.g., attributes in OO) and relationships (e.g.,
associations in OO). The conceptual distance between two
models can be measured syntactically by comparing commonly
occurring concepts, properties and relationships, versus
elements that only exist in one of the models. This is easy
to implement, but does not reflect that semantically
equivalent models may exist, even if their syntactic
representations differ. The syntactic differences may emerge
from the use of synonyms for similar terms, or from
structurally equivalent but unequal concept/relationship
formalizations. A conceptual distance measurement based on
semantic differences should consider the semantics of two
conceptual models and compare the sets of described
instances in a meaningful way. In conceptual modeling,
semantics is usually an infinite set of instances (e.g.,
object structures in OO). Conceptual distance may be
difficult to measure accurately.</p>

<p>In a development project, it is often desirable to identify
differences of evolved versions of models.
This is true for all modeling languages
such as code, state machines, class diagrams, use case
diagrams or any specific DSL. A pure syntactic
interpretation of the conceptual distance can be defined
generically by comparing the two models of a language and
counting differences and similarities for each language
construct (e.g., comparing “classes,” “attributes,” “states”
or any other language construct). A somewhat smarter
syntactic measurement could count “compatible” types as
similar elements (e.g., int and long). Other similarity
metrics could be based on the renaming of an element using a
synonym. Such smart measurements exist and can assist in
identifying variants of models in a product line development
setting.</p>

<p>If the meaning of a model (i.e., its semantics)
shall be used to measure conceptual distance of two models,
then the situation becomes rather diverse. For the category
of structural models (e.g., conceptual models, architectural
models, block or class diagrams), conceptual distance of two
models needs to compare the sets of possible instantiation
structures (which are sets of sets of elements, e.g.,
objects). For the category of behavioral models, the set of
possible behavior executions
(e.g., sets of traces) and their differences should be
analyzed. The conceptual distance of behavioral descriptions
can be defined inductively over time, because there is a
starting point, namely time point 0, from where all
behaviors initiate. Similarity of behavior descriptions
should typically regard the time point of the first
deviation of two behavioral executions: The earlier the
deviation can be observed, the larger the distance. All of
these considerations are complicated by non-deterministic
behavior of the described implementation, non-deterministic
behavior of the environment, under specification of the
models (which is not exactly the same, but similar to a
non-deterministic implementation) and the possibility to add
probabilities to all of the relevant concepts. This also
contributes to the challenge of measuring conceptual
distance accurately.</p>

<p>Beyond comparing individual model
instances, it is also possible to compare the conceptual
distance between two languages. Such a comparison can be
helpful when there is a need to understand the differences
between two programming languages, or also when trying to
understand the differences between two modeling languages
(or two variants of the same modeling language) that should
be used for the same purpose. Two possibilities exist for
such comparisons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1) When using meta-models (or grammar) to describe
languages, we can apply conceptual distance techniques to
the meta-models (or grammars) similar to the instance
models mentioned earlier</li>
  <li>(2) we can also analyze the distance by mapping one
language construct to a similar construct in the other
language (we will call this encoding)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is very common when learning a new programming language
by trying to understand how expressions, statements, case
distinctions, loops, lambda abstractions or functions are
defined in terms of other known languages. This mapping also
assists in identifying the absence of a familiar and helpful
construct in one language that may not be available in
another language. However, this approach does not always
allow objective measurements, but only give an informal
understanding of the conceptual distance of languages. Using
the encoding approach, we might argue that as the conceptual
distance between languages increases, the complexity of the
encoding also increases.</p>

<p>These observations lead us to an interesting point about
software engineering, from the simple viewpoint of starting
with a set of informal requirements, which are mapped down
through several high-level and low-level model
formalizations (as shown in the figure), and finally end up
in an executable implementation. Between each of those
modeling levels, the conceptual distance must be small
enough such that we can manage a systematic, sound mapping
between the levels. Usually, these mappings are not exactly
systematic encodings, but also add a lot of additional
human-constructed design decisions. However, the conceptual
distance still needs to be kept manageable. As a natural
consequence, in software-intensive complex systems we can
observe with increasing frequency that the development
paradigm used in the early stages may influence the
implementation. For example, using a component connector
architecture for high-level models of automotive software
will probably lead to the explicit existence of components,
connectors and ports in the final implementation. The
explicit existence of these constructs that exist in the
modeling languages creates overhead in the implementation,
but also keeps the development process manageable, more
efficient and potentially less erroneous. Furthermore,
variant management and reusability will probably increase. A
similar phenomenon occurs in workflow-intensive systems,
where workflow descriptions are based on modeling techniques
to organize and understand the system. Such systems vary
explicitly know and manage the workflows and their
respective states.</p>

<p>As a logical consequence, it can be
observed that the form of the high-level modeling languages
used to describe a system varies much according to the
shapes, structure and architecture of the implementation, as
well as the abstractions available in the implementation.
This helps to keep the conceptual distance between
requirements and implementation small and the development
manageable. Interestingly, this is different from other
engineering domains (e.g., architecture), where the
existence or form of models and plans has no impact on the
created building.</p>

<p>There is much more to be said about
conceptual distance and it is in particular to be
made more precise and thus measurable.
We look forward to investigations into
either comparisons of specific languages or as
general considerations
toward a theory of measuring conceptual distance.</p>
