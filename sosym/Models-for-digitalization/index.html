      <h5 id="digitalization">Digitalization</h5>

<p>“Digitalization” is an emerging trend, which
represents the integration of multiple technologies into all
aspects of daily life that can be digitized. A few examples
of digitalization include smart homes (for entertainment,
security, childcare, electrical, and heating), e-healthcare,
smart mobility, and smart cities. The widespread impact of
digitalization affects everything from personal
relationships augmented by social media and their services,
to other relationships such as how citizens interact with
support services in e-government.</p>

<p>Gartner defines digitalization with a more business-oriented
focus: “Digitalization is the use of digital technologies to
change a business model and provide new revenue and
value-producing opportunities; it is the process of moving
to a digital business.” (gartner.com/it-glossary in August
2015). This definition spans relationships between different
businesses, in addition to business and government, and the
vital relationship to customers. A goal is to realize
digitalization such that there is a clear relationship
between the services offered by businesses and the actual
needs of customers.</p>

<p>There are many domains that will benefit greatly from
digitalization: cultural artifacts and assets (e.g.,
artwork, historical relics, and documents) can be digitized
and therefore preserved and shown to the masses, even if
they were stolen, destroyed, or are just not directly
accessible. Scientists can now digitize their experiments,
such that their experimental setup and results can be
repeated much more easily to allow for further analysis and
scrutiny.</p>

<h5 id="digitalization-includes-abstraction">Digitalization includes Abstraction</h5>

<p>At a first glance, digitalization seems to concentrate on
data, such as the trend toward Big Data where large amounts
of data are made available through the Internet and
analyzable in the cloud. This kind of digital data itself
represents a model of the world that it describes. Most of
the data collected explicitly describe artifacts of the real
world, often in a raw and unstructured format. However, if
we want to draw information and knowledge from these data
sets (beyond a mere observation), we need to aggregate
relevant characteristics and abstract from many irrelevant
details to answer general questions. These aggregated
abstractions are also models that can describe the shared
and thus generalizable phenomena of artifacts, mechanisms,
and situations, as well as their individual unique
characteristics that allow scientists and the general
citizenry to understand specific aspects of the world.</p>

<p>This is true for the world, in general, as well as for
individual domains. For example, in the business domains,
digitalization often informs what and where to buy and sell,
how to advertise, how to efficiently produce and transport,
and how to keep contact with the customer. In production
mode, digitalization also means to design products in a
digital form, to virtually compose and exercise components
before producing the product, and to maintain the
relationship between a sold or rented product, its users,
and the producing company. In water and energy supply, as
well as transportation domains, digitalization can inform
the status, physical distribution, or position of the things
and people of interest, providing analytical capabilities
about necessary and future capacities related to
sustainability and scalability within a specific domain.</p>

<p>It is obvious that digitized data
describe a model that represents a part of the real world.
Models will be needed to store knowledge about all
interesting things, people, and events and their
relationships. Models are needed to describe procedural
knowledge, such as calculation algorithms, business
processes, critical loads or capacities, and their typical
appearance, among many other needs.</p>

<h5 id="digitalization-relies-on-models">Digitalization relies on Models</h5>

<p>Although we may agree that models are an important asset for
future digitalization efforts, the questions remain
regarding where do the models come from and how are they
denoted? In the Big Data context, models are extracted from
an abundant volume of data that is represented in a variety
of formats, where models may not be very explicit. Often,
this also means that the underlying modeling language is
relatively implicit, even though many modeling languages
share a lot of similarities with either state machine for
behavior and object diagrams for structural elements and
their relationships. These implicit modeling languages will
differ in details, because some models will need more
expressivity. Other models may explicitly incorporate
uncertainty or non-determinism of their underlying data. We
think it is necessary to investigate appropriate approaches
for language definition to describe the principal and
possible forms of the models, which will then describe the
real-world assets or derivations of interesting knowledge
that can be inferred from the data represented in the
models.</p>

<h5 id="digital-transformation">Digital Transformation</h5>

<p>“Digital transformation” is meaning the active act of transforming
a business, process, or product towards becoming increasingly digital.
The phrase is also emerging as a buzzword that allows different
stakeholders to inject various forms of innovation into
their respective company, business, government, academic
institution, or other public services. The nuances of
digital transformation are broad and have not yet been
defined precisely, but even job advertisements often contain
the phrase.</p>

<p>Deconstructing the term from its two primary words, we
identify two well-known concepts. “Transformation” describes
a general process that starts with some initial situation
that moves toward a changed, and supposedly better
situation. May be that in this case the word transformation
is not the best word choice because the underlying
transformation may never meet a stable end, but rather
undergo a continual set of evolutionary optimizations
related to new forms of business, production, logistics,
medicine or other changes within the targeted domain.
“Digital” suggests that many changes in society, business
and industry will be driven by information technologies that
allow data to be processed in real-time and even used to
intelligently derive information to finally to provide
stakeholders with improved knowledge about their processes
and products. Downstream digitization would also allow
optimization, automation activities and production
techniques of various forms.</p>

<p>We already discussed, models have much potential
toward achieving the goals of digital transformation.
Below
are a few possible contexts for application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(M1) One of our colleagues, Ulrich Frank, recently stated that
models can be used beneficially to mitigate the
differences and challenges that emerge between different
worlds that speak very unique languages. This becomes
obvious when considering the various stakeholders that
come into contact with Digital Products or services. Each
stakeholder may have individual domain-specific terms to
describe his or her needs, capabilities, and unique
information resources.</li>
  <li>(M2) Digital transformation often co-exists with large data
sets that are associated with some processing need of the
transformation context. Data has structure. For an
explicit, well-founded handling of this data, models are
necessary to describe the data structure, but also how to
manipulate the data and retrieve it efficiently.
Transformation models describe how to slice, select, join,
or aggregate data to retrieve useful information. Beyond
manipulation of data, there is much software that is
necessary to handle, manage and visualize this data. In
the future, traditional software engineering techniques
may use models to design such systems, or models at
runtime will describe specific techniques within a rather
generic software package (e.g., database, statistics
packages or visualization components).</li>
  <li>(M3) The design of digital products and the development of
product lines using digital technologies will lead to a
very challenging integration problem for the physical
components of a system, as well as the development
methodologies and their tools. Many of these tools use
very specific forms of models, written in proprietary or
semi-standardized modeling languages, that will need a
syntactic, semantic and tool-based integration.</li>
  <li>(M4) While traditional engineering uses human-generated
models to prescribe aspects of the system under
development, machine learning and data mining techniques
have the potential to reverse this relation by extracting
models from sets of running data. It will be interesting
to see how prescriptive and extracted models fit together,
if at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a deep list of research topics that need to be
explored in order to derive the understanding that will
bring a pure data-driven world together with prescriptive
design models. Particularly, the application of machine
learning currently too often relearns already well-known
models, because prescriptive models and machine learning are
not well integrated. Colleagues recently applied big data
analytics in a larger industrial project that at first and
foremost re-uncovered basic physical laws from a set of
production data. While this result may be interesting from a
machine learning perspective, the end result was not very
helpful given the physical laws were already well-known.</p>

<h5 id="digitalization-relies-on-model-standards">Digitalization relies on Model Standards</h5>

<p>Currently, several standards for describing various physical
or behavioral assets of the real world are in development.
Such standards contain a meta-model that shapes the models
allowed by the standard. For example, buildings are
described through building information models using one of
the various BIM standards. Furthermore, models of electrical
circuits as well as mechanical machines and business
processes are standardized in a series of partially still-evolving standards. However, these standards are now
becoming digitalized, allowing the models to be accessible
in digitalized form to analyze, synthesize, evolve, compose,
and compare them before buying or developing the product.</p>

<p>The modeling community needs to embrace the move toward
digitalization by helping in the definition of new and
evolving standards. The modeling community also needs to
help in shaping the tooling infrastructure for these
standards, such as the creation of meta-models for specific
domains of the digitalized world. We firmly believe that all
the effort that the modeling community has undertaken to
define modeling languages, semantics, and pragmatics, to
understand what makes a good model, and to analyze,
synthesize, compose, merge, slice, and transform models,
will give us a great opportunity to contribute to the
digitization of the world and its assets.</p>
