      <p>White Paper by Bernhard Rumpe, Software Engineering, RWTH Aachen, Update June 17, 2024</p>

<p>Research Software Engineering (RSE) is a term that was created around 2010 and
has started to become prominent in the UK, the US, and now also Germany.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia </a> (in
June 2024) defines it this way:</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Research Software Engineering (RSE) </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Research Software Engineering</strong> is the use of Software Engineering 
practices, methods and techniques for research software, i.e. software 
that was made for and is mainly used within research projects.</p>

  
</div>

<p>Even though the definition also sketches what research software is,
this definition is quite fine. It embedds the software development 
skills of the RSE domain as a special subfield to Software Engineering, 
while also stretching that specific domain knowledge, 
namely from the research domain is also needed.</p>

<p>In this white paper, we (1) define the most relevant terms,
(2) discuss the similarities and differences 
between Software Engineering and RSE, and (3) at the end provide 
recommendations for researchers and universities on how to address the 
emerging challenges. We approach these topics from our personal 
Software Engineering perspective, intentionally omitting 
domain-specific considerations, which are undoubtedly just as crucial.</p>

<h3 id="software-engineering-se">Software Engineering (SE)</h3>

<p>Similar to the original term “software engineering”, the creation 
of “RSE” was felt necessary because there was and is a crisis in software 
development, especially a <em>“research software crisis”</em>. Software 
Engineering gained prominence when F. L. Bauer hosted the first 
conference on Software Engineering in 1968 to address the software 
crisis. Since then, the Software Engineering discipline has gained significant 
understanding of software development cumulating in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>several introductory and expert books on software engineering,</li>
  <li>many more books on dedicated sub-fields of software 
engineering, namely requirements engineering, architecture, design, 
modeling, testing, development processes, and of course programming,</li>
  <li>and the <em><a href="https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)</a></em> 
that structures and aggregates what software developers have learned in 
the last 50 years.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="software-engineering-challenges">Software Engineering Challenges</h5>

<p>Software is rather heterogeneous, ranging from embedded to desktop, to 
autonomous, to games, to business, and also to research software. While 
the problems are always the same, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to ensure the quality of the software?</li>
  <li>How to efficiently develop the software (i.e., preserve developer 
resources)?</li>
  <li>How to meet timing deadlines?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answers and then, in particular, the development techniques are often 
different in the various sub-areas of software development, because the 
starting situation, the kind of software, the complexity drivers, the 
needed quality characteristics, the context in which the software is 
operating in, and the skills and preferences of the developers are 
different.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="software-engineering-50-years-culminating-in-the-swebok">Software Engineering: 50 years, culminating in the SWEBOK</h5>

<p>The <em>Software Engineering Body of Knowledge</em> (SWEBOK) defines 15 
knowledge areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Requirements</li>
  <li>Software Design</li>
  <li>Software Construction</li>
  <li>Software Testing</li>
  <li>Software Maintenance</li>
  <li>Software Configuration Management</li>
  <li>Software Engineering Management</li>
  <li>Software Engineering Process</li>
  <li>Software Engineering Models and Methods</li>
  <li>Software Quality</li>
  <li>Software Engineering Professional Practice</li>
  <li>Software Engineering Economics</li>
  <li>Computing Foundations</li>
  <li>Mathematical Foundations</li>
  <li>Engineering Foundations</li>
</ul>

<p>For business software, we know that the programming activities only 
cost about 15% of the overall development time. For skilled and educated 
people constructing the actual software is a relatively well-understood 
activity, but many very costly errors are made due to misunderstandings about 
the requirements or incorrect definition of the architecture.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="software-engineering-areas">Software Engineering Areas</h5>

<p>Software Engineering doesn’t only comprise the subdisciplines mentioned 
above, which cover the different activities within a software 
engineering project. Due to the various application areas, software 
engineering is also organized in domain-specific subdisciplines or 
partners with related domain-specific topics, so that a holistic, 
integrative development approach becomes feasible. These areas include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automotive Software Engineering,</li>
  <li>Information Systems,</li>
  <li>Avionics Systems and Software Engineering,</li>
  <li>Rail Software Engineering,</li>
  <li>Embedded Software,</li>
  <li>Cloud Software Engineering,</li>
  <li>Data Science and Engineering,</li>
  <li>Medical Software Engineering,</li>
  <li>Government Software Engineering</li>
  <li>Gaming Software Engineering</li>
  <li>and now also Research Software Engineering.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other domains, like Quantum Software Engineering, are also emerging.</p>

<p>In the Automotive Software Engineering branch 
many developers historically transitioned from 
their domain (i.e. mechanics and electronics) 
to learning coding and later also Software Engineering 
techniques, while still using and evolving their knowledge on the 
original domain. 
ASE nowadays encompasses a wide range of people with diverse 
skill sets and roles, ranging from software architects and coders to 
quality assurance, safety or security specialists, all knowing about 
engineering cars as well. Some 
even take on the role of product owners. These 
professionals use a variety of “Automotive Software Engineering” 
techniques and methods, though their individual job titles vary widely. 
This approach could potentially serve also as a framework for Research 
Software Engineering (RSE), where more software-oriented developers might 
identify themselves as “RSEs”, others are “Scientists Who Code”, and
yet others may be
specialized “Research Software Tool Engineers”. 
No one needs to master 
all existing SE techniques, but only the relevant ones. 
To select the relevant ones, it helps that an RSE knows what SE 
techniques exist.</p>

<h3 id="research-software">Research Software</h3>

<p>Since 2010 communities have been created, conferences have been organized, 
and people exchange their findings on how to overcome the 
challenges of research software development, i.e., how to overcome the 
research software crisis.</p>

<p>What differentiates the challenges of RSE from other forms of SE?</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="kinds-of-research-software">Kinds of Research Software</h5>

<p>First, we recognize that there is no uniform kind of research 
software. Instead research software mainly falls into one of the 
following categories (and sometimes combinations thereof):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embedded control software for complex physical or chemical 
experiments, including many forms of sensor-based data collections</li>
  <li>Simulation of physical, chemical, social, or biological processes in 
geometrically distributed spaces</li>
  <li>Data processing and aggregation</li>
  <li>Symbolic manipulation systems, such as computer algebra systems or 
theorem provers</li>
  <li>Demonstrators and prototypes of various forms and with a large 
variety of goals</li>
</ul>

<p>While the embedded control software also has its challenges, the 
main challenges seem to be the simulation and the data processing codes,
that are so heavily needed by researchers.</p>

<p>But software consists of parts from different technical domains. While
obviously, the mathematical research part receives the main focus in practically
useful programs, this often amounts to only 20-30% of the code (this number is
estimated, based on personal insights to some projects, but not thoroughly
validated). The majority of code has to deal with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>App infrastructure</li>
  <li>User interactions</li>
  <li>Visualization</li>
  <li>Storage and transaction management</li>
  <li>Communication between computing and storage nodes</li>
  <li>Interacting with neighboring systems</li>
  <li>Providing web services</li>
  <li>Rights and roles management for access and prevention of undetected 
changes</li>
  <li>Technical monitoring</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Installation, deployment and orchestration</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is very similar to many other kinds of software. The amount of 
technical code tends to grow more quickly than the functional research part.
Addressing the technical aspects is practically the more difficult task for 
non-software-engineers, especially the integration of technologies.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="characteristics-of-research-software">Characteristics of Research Software</h5>

<p>Several common characteristics of research software are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is used for research in the original research domain and thus 
originally only a by-product, and also treated as such.</li>
  <li>Focus is on the publication of the results.</li>
  <li>Requirements of the software under development are initially unclear 
and the software development process is heavily intertwined with the 
research and innovation process, both on the scientific domain and its 
mapping into software.</li>
  <li>It is developed by researchers of various domains, but mainly not by 
computer scientists (nor by software engineers)
    <ul>
      <li>An often seen scenario: 
The complete software is developed by a single Ph.D. candidate
and erodes after the Ph.D. is finished.</li>
      <li>A similar scenario: The overall software is complex and has been 
developed over a long period of time by many developers, 
but the newly added packages
also only have a single Ph.D. author and erode after they leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reuse is difficult, because the software is not designed for reuse.</li>
  <li>Applicability of the software is limited, because it has been designed for a
single use case or a small set of use cases and it wasn’t designed for
extensibility and flexibility.</li>
  <li>The software is frequently rewritten:
    <ul>
      <li>Within a Ph.D. project, when the desired outcomes (i.e. requirements) 
change, rewriting is applied.</li>
      <li>If a new researcher takes the existing software, then a long
lasting rewriting takes place to accommodate the new developers
preferences. (In the sense of “Don’t trust foreign code”)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Goals of the research institution, respectively their professorial 
leaders, significantly differ from the goals of the developing 
researchers, namely: long-lasting, sustainable software programs that 
can be used as infrastructure for research vs. obtaining quickly 
publishable insights.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the world is changing and the demand for reproducibility of results
enforces additional publication of the data and of the underlying software in a 
form that is permanently available and executable.
Zenodo, for example, stores software permanently, but doesn’t ensure 
executability (yet). Code Ocean, however, already does.</p>

<h3 id="research-software-engineering">Research Software Engineering</h3>

<p>As a consequence of the sustainability and reproducibility 
requirements on research software, the software turns from a by-product 
into a long-living, sustainable asset, if not into a core research 
infrastructure, where the demands for code quality heavily increases. 
As a consequence of the software crisis in other 
development domains, software engineering has already discussed these and 
other 
typical quality attributes, namely 
understandability, documentation, reuse, or the ability to 
evolve a while ago.</p>

<p>It is therefore time to put the focus on the question of how to transfer the
body of software engineering knowledge to at least the sustainability of
research software. We remember:</p>

<p>“<strong>Research Software Engineering</strong> is the use of Software Engineering 
practices in research applications.”</p>

<p>But which practices are actually useful in RSE? Which can be ignored? Which 
are omitted or forgotten, but would be useful?</p>

<p>We observe:</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="focus-processing-efficiency"><strong><em>Focus: Processing Efficiency</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> The focus of many SE techniques is the efficiency of the 
developers during the development project, because complexity of 
software functions is more demanding than the size of data and the 
computational effort.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> Traditionally, High-Performance Computing (HPC, which covers a
large part of RSE) focuses mainly 
on execution times. Simulations and various other forms of number 
crunching and data processing force RSE to put focus on the efficiency of 
programs.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> The complexity of programs steadily increases and probably 
both, the efficiency of the developers and the program will receive 
focus in the future.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="reuse"><strong><em>Reuse</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> SE traditionally focuses on the reuse and provides a large set of 
mechanisms to increase the reusability of software. This starts with 
language constructs, such as inheritance, the import of other 
modules/classes, and explicit definition of interfaces that allow (but not 
enforce(!)) reuse. This continues on the methodological level, where 
development processes for frameworks, for features in software product 
lines, for components, microservices, independently deployable and 
versioned subsystems, etc. are established. Architectural and 
design patterns are of great help. Software design and architecture must 
anticipate reuse.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> To some extent RSE uses these techniques, but too often these 
high-level techniques are not applied. That is natural, as the 
focus is not on reuse and explicit architectural design activities are not 
in place. In order to increase reusability rewriting code is fostered.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="modularity"><strong><em>Modularity</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> Modularity is a core technique to assist in fostering reusability. 
It is applied on various levels, starting with the building of classes, and 
the design and architecture of components, subsystems, etc. Modularity 
starts with the requirements, but enforces much focus during 
architectural design, affects the organization of distributed 
development and modular quality assurance. Achieving modularity is a 
professional skill that has to be learned and trained.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> Modularity is applied mainly in class design.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="modeling"><strong><em>Modeling</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> Explicit use of software models using UML (or SysML) is common in 
SE. Domain specific languages (DSL) are used in various domains with specific 
characteristics, as well as for configuration and increase of modular 
use of components. These DSLs include, e.g., building information 
modeling (BIM), control automata, etc.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> Sometimes modeling is applied in RSE as well. The core form 
of models are the mathematical constraints between physical quantities, timing 
and geometric topics. Many of them are differential equations.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> The mathematical constraints, typically defined in 
scientific papers, and their software implementation need to be focused 
more. RSE tools need to better assist in explicitly specifying limitations, 
especially for ensuring the consistency between efficient 
implementations and the mathematical formulae (seen as requirements), and for
tracing changes. This may include generators, more domain-specific 
languages, but also more math compilers. But also the software itself 
will need design techniques and the variants of UML-like techniques need to be 
integrated.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="automation-with-smart-tools"><strong><em>Automation With Smart Tools</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> Continuous integration is of great help for developers to get 
immediate feedback and for project managers to keep track and an 
overview of the projects progress. Tools are commonly used that help with
refactoring, detect malicious or dead code, security vulnerabilities, 
architectural deficiencies, etc.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> In RSE these techniques are applied, e.g., using Git, GitHub, or 
GitLab capabilities.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> Assistance seems to be helpful for purposeful use. RSE 
specific solutions could help even more. Existing continuous integration 
approaches, that aim for short turn-around times, are challenged by those kinds 
of research software, that require many computational resources to train models.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="versioning"><strong><em>Versioning</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE &amp; RSE:</strong> The Git version control systems with openly accessible 
tools such as GitHub as well as the locally deployable tooling and
infrastructures such as GitLab are generally applicable in SE. Such tools 
provide helpful assistance: e.g. a ticket system, continuous integration, 
versioning assistance, branching, variability management, etc. Skillfully 
applied these improve the development process intensively.</li>
  <li>
<strong>SE &amp; RSE tomorrow:</strong> Currently many tools are developed around Git to 
improve their assistance even further. For example, detecting security 
breaches, automatic deployment, artifact management, and documentation 
generation help developers in their tasks.
Increasingly, projects, companies, and sometimes also specific communities 
create their domain-specific tools, which know specificities about the 
domain and as such can help developing and maintaining the code even better. 
The Linux open source project with its kernel, master and lieutenant system 
may act as a good blueprint to build a chain of trust and quality.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="long-lasting--sustainable-software"><strong><em>Long-Lasting / Sustainable Software</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> It is true, that in RSE some larger (but by far not all) pieces 
of programs should be long-lasting and sustainable. This allows these programs 
to become reusable for various research questions to be addressed.</li>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> This is true for other software as well. Billions of Euros, 
US Dollars, etc. have been invested in developing software, e.g., in 
insurances, banks, government, and back-offices of companies, and those 
assets must be usable as long as possible.</li>
  <li>
<strong>SE &amp; RSE:</strong> General SE and RSE face the same problems. Even though the 
underlying development goals of RSE are special, the methods to 
achieve sustainability for software are potentially similar. 
This does not only include the software, but also it’s accessibility, 
e.g., in form of documentation and the people that have knowledge 
about the software in its complexity. Open source development alone is not 
enough to ensure sustainability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Longevity requirements have different foundations on scientific and 
technical code: Scientific code handles the scientific questions and 
solutions, e.g., its core is the implementation of formulae. These 
aspects should be subject to improvement, extension, or replacement by 
researchers, i.e. scientits who code. Technical code, e.g., for 
parallelization, database connectivity, user interfaces, etc. is less 
influenced by scientific progress, but by technological progress. These 
parts should be subject to change by software developers or software 
engineers, e.g. by tailoring existing frameworks and library towards 
RSE.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="reproducibility"><strong><em>Reproducibility</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> This challenge occurs, e.g., when legal aspects come into 
play. Banks and insurances have to provide access to the software to tax 
authorities even 10 years after the software was taken out of 
operation in hot standby and be able to reconstruct the software 
service for 20 years while the underlying computing infrastructure and 
contextual systems evolve rapidly, and the correctness of the 
software has to be ensured at all times.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> In RSE the same problem occurs, even though the reason is 
different: the timing is not constrained by legislation, but by scientific 
standards.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="framework-development-strategies"><strong><em>Framework Development Strategies</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> SE has created various forms of modularity and reusability, 
including the concept of frameworks with hot spots, various forms of 
configuration techniques and tooling. Frameworks differ from pure 
libraries, because they are tightly integrated, establish the control flow, 
and allow developers to plug in individual adaptations of functionality.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> RSE mainly creates monolithic codes, which are openly accessible, 
but difficult to understand. Documentation is sometimes available, often as 
reference to (static, unchangeable) published papers. Libraries of core 
functions are established.</li>
</ul>

<p>The development of research software that directly contributes to a 
publishable research subject tends to be preferred by scientists over the 
development of libraries, frameworks, reference models (such as reference 
architectures or reference domain models) and other utilities, 
that support the development of future research software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> The framework and the product line concepts must be 
applied more often to achieve the benefits stated above. Incentives must be 
established for researchers of different career levels to develop and maintain 
libraries, frameworks, and reference models for research software.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="testing"><strong><em>Testing</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> A tremendous amount of theory and practical advice regarding 
testing is available, allowing to develop tests for various purposes: from 
small unit tests, through component and integration tests, up to end-to-end 
user tests covering requirements, models, code and input data spaces in 
appropriate form. Testing frameworks allow to easily automate these tests and 
thus repeat them on each evolutionary step.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> Testing is not common in RSE. Test automation is widely ignored. 
To some extent this is because manual tests have been sufficient in a setting 
with reduced execution variability. Sometimes there is only one data set and 
testing is equal to execution and getting the result immediately. So far 
plausibility checks often replace testing.
Due to the nature of research, often no oracle exists for expected results, 
making end-to-end tests difficult to develop.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> RSE will need more automatic, repeatable tests. It may be
that the form of end-to-end tests is rather specific, because e.g. in 
simulations the timing aspect plays a role. Testing massively distributed
software also has its own challenges. Adequate tooling is needed, because
otherwise evolution and reproducibility are not achievable.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="development-methods"><strong><em>Development Methods</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> Various forms of development methods have been established. These 
include V-model, Rational Unified Process, Extreme Programming, Scrum, 
and many other agile or more document oriented development processes.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> Hacking still applied too often. Especially the requirements 
engineering process very much differs from traditional SE. In many 
Ph.D. projects the candidate is developer and their own sole customer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> Depending on the form of software, the number of 
people, their skills, the expected quality and outcomes, timelines, 
etc. several different methods will be needed. The core need 
will be that someone in the project knows about the activities and their 
interactions in development projects, selects the right process and 
ensures that the participants live it in the project. Taking responsibility is 
important for these projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exploration of new research ideas plays a major role in RSE 
and must be well integrated into an RSE method.
Again, explicit innovation enabling techniques are already well 
established in core SE and should be applicable in adapted form.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="consulting"><strong><em>Consulting</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>SE:</strong> In the industrial practice of SE, consulting has become a major 
driving force. There is a large set of companies that employ 
consultants of various specific skills, who are working in sometimes 
large projects to develop various forms of software.
    <ul>
      <li>Skills may be technical, for example dealing with specific 
software stacks, or they may be applicable for specific activities, 
such as architectural design, requirements engineering, testing, 
database connection, installing software as a service, or
tool building and adaptation.</li>
      <li>Consulting may also consist of various different activities, such as 
providing templates, giving courses, training on the job,
code reviews, tool and software stack assistance, or other kinds of
trouble-shooting and problem-solving.</li>
      <li>Even co-development is doable, when domain-specific 
know how and thus pi-shaped skills (software 
engineering + domain knowledge) are present.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE:</strong> First research organizations are starting to apply in-house 
consulting.</li>
  <li>
<strong>RSE tomorrow:</strong> In-house consulting is a possibility and maybe also a 
necessity to temporarily bring experienced developers with specific skills 
to the application projects that need these skills. 
As a consequence, groups of skilled software engineers (including 
developers) will be established at least at larger research 
organizations, to assist in various development stages and potentially 
also maintenance and curation in the later phases of sustainable 
software.</li>
</ul>

<p>An overall impression remains that guidelines for RSE are necessary, 
alongside tailored processes and methods for the special needs of RSE.</p>

<h3 id="rse-research"><em>RSE Research</em></h3>

<p>For a precise understanding we put this into parentheses: <em>((research software)
engineering) research)</em> is a foundational field of research that focuses on the
engineering techniques, tools, methods, frameworks, etc. to develop research
software. It will take inspiration from (generic) software engineering research
and find solutions specific for other research domains.</p>

<p>RSE research has to tackle a number of questions that<br>
address the software as a produced result, but also the 
assistance for the domain-specific 
researcher as a human being with limited time and 
always optimizable skills for software 
development. Some of these questions are rather fundamental research, 
other should be acompanied by empirical software engineering or
organisational, economic research:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How does RSE differ from SE and what specific activities have to be 
addressed by different methods and tools?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can classic SE approaches, like the V-Model, RUP, Scrum, 
or Xtreme Programming be adapted to RSE needs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or is an entirely new development process needed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to run empirical validation in such a context? (At least researchers 
could understand that empirical validation is needed, and would 
hopefully assist?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to adapt research software requirements elicitation for RSE? 
This activity is typically deeply 
connected with the domain-specific research process itself, which is why
traditional requirements engineering techniques don’t fit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to define robust architectures that are extensible, maintainable, 
and allow a reusability for research software, where the forms of 
extensions, and connections to neighboring functionalities are initially very 
unpredictable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to assist RSE with domain-specific frameworks and reference models 
(reference architectures and reference domain data models)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to gain precise understanding of optimal forms of reuse: From (1) 
simple copy-paste, through (2) branching and (3) black-box reuse up to 
(4) pre-deployed service reuse? This is needed across heterogenous 
languages, software-stacks, and hardware infrastructures and it must be seen in 
the context of long-term evolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to document and model the desired software with the purpose of 
(a) effective development, (b) possible code generation, (c) sustainable 
reproducibility, and (d) comprehension in the sense of FAIR research 
data management? This is a multidimensional problem, because software 
needs to evolve, because of (1) bugfixing and (2) evolution of the 
software stack it is embedded in, such as underlying external data sets 
and their service APIs, security patches of the operating system or
libraries, etc. Docker is only of local help, here.
Software also comes in technical and functional variants 
and is a lively object that very much differs from passive data. 
Currently, research data management initiatives, such as the German FDMI, 
are only starting to address this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to manage long-term evolution with fluctuating developer 
groups?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to manage, govern, and analyze variant-aware and variant-rich 
research software in long-term projects?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What tools are needed to easily automate various tedious activities 
that researchers would like to avoid?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kinds of software engineering models are of use in RSE?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to integrate mathematical models (e.g. based on calculus),
Software Engineering models (e.g. UML, SysML) and leverage their 
effective use in development?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are useful domain-specific languages (DSLs) for RSE, either to
raise developer efficiency or to decrease quality issues?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which RSE activities can be assisted by DSLs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can DSLs bridge the published mathematical, physical,
biological, medical, etc. laws and findings on the one hand and the
executable code on the other hand?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can mathematical / physical laws themselves be codified as DSL models
and thus used for validation, testing or even code generation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is appropriate meta-information about research software artifacts, 
their development states and forms of review, certifications etc. to build trust, 
enable reusability, and document quality?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refactoring the architecture of research software to fit future needs
while retaining current capabilities?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can software analysis tools contribute to, e.g., checking 
consistency between mathematical models in published papers and the 
implemented code? Might this even lead to a change in the forms of
our publications?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can traditional program analysis tools e.g. 
for dead code, inefficient code, architecture leaks, or
unnecessary complexity effectively help the researchers to 
improve software quality?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to test and what to test in which intensity? Hat are sufficient tests
in the context of big data sets or unclear desired outcomes?
How to overcome the unknown test oracle problem?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a notion of test coverage for research software?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is high-quality assurance for research software in order to 
achieve high-quality research results? We need adequate and efficient 
testing, reasoning, reviewing, and certification procedures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can an intelligent research co-pilot based on large language models help 
to address coding, testing, design and quality issues?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to quantitatively assess and optimize development skills for researchers?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much does the human developer play a role in RSE developments?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to design software for user studies in social and economic experiments
that interact with test probands?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to predict development efforts and costs of a scientific development 
process? (“CoMoMo for research software?”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to deal with legacy software or legacy hardware in a long-lasting 
software infrastructure setting? How to migrate scientific software?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to predict needed computational, storage and networking ressources 
for a software experiment/simulation/study upfront?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to measure the scientific quality of research software?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many of those questions are not specific to RSE, but apply to classic 
SE as well. While some of these questions are very general, the answers must 
typically be very domain-specific to gain improvements for the domain-specific 
challenges. Classic SE has many (and still optimizable) 
answers to these questions, but if it is unclear, how they transfer to RSE.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="some-research-topic-examples"><strong><em>Some Research Topic Examples</em></strong></h5>

<p>The following is a very incomplete set of research topics, just to give 
examples of what is needed (and what we would like to build research about):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consistency between academic papers and code, through techniques like:
    <ul>
      <li>Code generation using a LaTeX formula as DSL, or something very similar</li>
      <li>Code generation from new DSLs that generates to code and LaTeX</li>
      <li>Deriving test cases from scientific papers (in case no code can be 
generated)</li>
      <li>Verification of the relationship of the code to the mathematical model</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code analysis as retrospective: Not only with the usual code analysis 
results such as deadlock freedom, but to answer the question of whether 
the code covers the right scientific models (up to numerical analysis 
of rounding problems).</p>
  </li>
  <li>“Research ChatGPT” as the co-pilot for scientists:
    <ul>
      <li>for creating both code and tests,</li>
      <li>and if models are relevant, also for finding scientific relations 
in the form of mathematical models.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Energetic analysis: CO~2~ footprint of the software.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we combine mathematical models (essentially differential equations)
with the theory of digital software models (mainly automata, Petri nets,
temporal logic, etc. and also structural models such as class diagrams). There
is still not a reasonable solution today – probably also because there is no
optimal solution, but dependening on the scale of the processes these different
kinds of models interact differently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Domain Specific Languages (DSL) for research</strong> (like we do in 
<a href="/research/MontiCore/">MontiCore</a>): Sometimes it may be 
worthwhile to provide researchers with 
a conceptually reduced, problem-adapted language and allow researchers 
to model in their own vocabulary instead of writing code.</li>
</ul>

<p>One bottom line here is: The connections between</p>
<ul>
  <li>scientific publication,</li>
  <li>domain theory and its models,</li>
  <li>code, and</li>
  <li>tests</li>
</ul>

<p>are to be addressed even more clearly. Ideally, these are treated with 
automated solutions, which obviously also include a variety of tools 
specifically dedicated to research software.</p>

<p>
  <img src="/assets/img/icons/balken.jpeg" width="100%" alt="" title="Trennlinie" class="trennlinie">
</p>

<h3 id="recommendations-and-concluding-observations">Recommendations and Concluding Observations</h3>

<p>The development of research software faces the same challenges as 
developing any other kind of software. The software engineering body 
of knowledge addresses these challenges and is of considerable help. 
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet and software engineers are 
not firefighters, who can easily rescue software that has degraded over 
several years. However, software engineering sometimes provides 
witchcraft-like techniques, which help best, when applied early.</p>

<p><em>Research software engineering</em> correctly pushes these techniques into 
development projects for researchers, but domain-specific adaptations 
are necessary.</p>

<p>Software development tools for the automation of various activities 
and wizard-like assistance have enormously increased productivity 
and simplified the hurdles for newcomers to create pieces of software. 
Moreover, these tools nowadays enable non-experts to develop significant 
pieces of software and leverage the knowledge of core software structures, 
such as persistent storage, communication, compilation, computation 
orchestration, etc.</p>

<p>Computer science can be  proud of having understood the core 
technologies, turning scientific knowledge into automatically 
executable algorithms and frameworks, and embedding these into tools 
usable by non-experts without having a deep understanding of the 
internal mechanisms of these tools. This also includes integrated 
development environments (IDEs) with highly assistive editors, Low Code 
approaches using scientific or other explicit modeling techniques, 
automated continuous integration, code analysis, etc.</p>

<p>Computer science can be proud of enabling non-experts to write 
expert-like software. No one might believe, that building even such a 
simple thing as a single-family house can be done by non-architects, but 
in software development, we have achieved exactly this. 
This is why probably the hard part for an RSE is to understand its 
research domain, while the easier part is (and should be) to understand
software development as well.</p>

<p>But the tooling 
infrastructure is still under intense development, and much more can 
be done to simplify the jobs of RSEs and also “Scientists who Code”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong><em>Recommendation 1</em></strong>: It is necessary to build better domain-specific 
tooling to address the domain-specific challenges of research software. 
Wizard-like smart tools help development amateurs and, to some 
extent, prevent them from having to focus too much on SE skills 
themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smart, possibly domain-specific tooling is part of the research 
infrastructure and needs high quality. It cannot only be a research 
prototype and thus should be professionally planned, engineered, and 
managed.</p>

<p>However, there is complexity in research software that doesn’t go away. 
If the software shall not be a throw-away software, there are 
additional methodical topics to address, that currently cannot be 
completely automated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong><em>Recommendation 2</em></strong>: Researchers who create software for a 
sustainable, long-lasting infrastructure need to be trained in software 
engineering skills, which drastically differ from mere programming 
skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all developed software needs to sustain. Sometimes simple throw-away 
experiments are ok, but developers should be aware of the expected 
outcomes and life expectancies of these outcomes. Their development 
processes should contain the appropriate measures and mechanisms to 
achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Researchers need to be aware that software engineering is not only about 
getting the code right but also involves architectural, design, quality 
assurance, and management soft-skills to be adopted and lived during a 
development process.</p>

<p>The development process for sustainable, widely used software is 
different from that of one-shot software. Managers (i.e. typically 
institute leaders) need to be aware of that and manage development
accordingly from the beginning.</p>

<p>Because we know that practically applicable 
software engineering skills are not easily 
obtained, there is a third relevant possibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong><em>Recommendation 3</em></strong>: Have one or more software engineers be part 
of your project to get the software and the technical architecture 
right, adopt the appropriate tools and quality mechanisms, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can, for example, be done by permanent employment in a project but 
also by consulting offers, which seems to be an increasingly feasible 
approach. Various British institutes seem to have started this approach 
by installing <em>research software engineering coaching</em> with primary 
software engineering skills and some secondary knowledge about the 
research domain. This seems to be promising because software engineers 
are trained to collaborate, and software engineering methods very well 
assist collaborative approaches.</p>

<p>Such a coaching group could be established centrally in the University 
and provide individual coaching, methodical upskilling or manage 
specific tasks, such as architectural refactoring, migration in the 
software stack, retrofitting security, or quality enhancements in the 
respective projects.</p>

<p>Upskilling is also needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Recommendation 4</strong>: Start teaching RSE skills to researchers that 
go beyond mere coding capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently it seems, that many researchers know how to code, but are not even 
aware that software development also provides methodological support 
for other activities of the development. Teaching these seems to be necessary. 
These researchers need not to be experts in software development, but 
some upskilling seems helpful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Recommendation 5</strong>: Incentives to use RSE best practices must 
be developed for all stakeholders involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there are long-term benefits for the scientific community to develop
sustainable software. The software engineers developing and maintaining 
the research software 
not necessarily benefit from enhanced quality, but only from improved efficiency. 
Combined with the risks of non permanent assignments of budget for 
RSE, it is not per se interesting 
for young researchers (with time limited contracts) to establish good RSE practices.</p>

<p>There should be long-lasting contracts for developers and for maintenance 
tasks. Developing and maintaining research software should be able to pay off 
for Ph.D. theses. Postdocs should benefit from developing, maintaining, and 
evolving research software for their next career steps. E.g., in Germany, 
evolving and maintaining a research software should be significantly positive 
with respect to pursuing a habilitation thesis or to get a junior professorship. 
Finally, assinging budget and time for good RSE should support the career of 
professors, e.g., by valuing the continuous development of research software in 
appointment negotiations and project proposal evaluations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it needs to be considered that not every group can have 
its own individually developed software codes, but codes should be 
developed and maintained over several groups respectively in a whole 
community. This can only be achieved, if (a) technically the 
architecture of the overall system is modular and decomposable, so that 
individual subgroups do not interfere too much and (b) organizationally 
a Plugin-structure allows different individual research groups to 
provide visual contributions (under their own names). Sich software 
then becomes a plattform with plugins, variability and extensibility 
options. Software engineering techniques provide such options, but RSE 
specific adaptions are definitely needed.</p>

<p>Software engineering is a holistic approach, and many strategic 
decisions have to be made, therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong><em>Recommendation 6</em></strong>: Establishing RSE principles is a core topic 
especially for the management, i.e. the professors and the research 
institutions, that needs to be addressed adequately.</li>
</ul>

<p>And to give various stakeholders a concrete assistance for what needs 
to be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong><em>Recommendation 7</em></strong>: Establish a <em>Software Development Guideline</em> 
for the projects or even for the whole institution, that cover (a) 
organizational issues, (b) legal issues e.g. with copyrights, and 
especially (c) a methodological process framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such a methodological process framework must be taking size, 
criticality, relevance for the university, expected duration of 
usefulness, heterogeneity of users, expected TRL (technology rediness 
level) and potentially other key metrics into account and give useful 
help to select the appropriate methods, activities, and tooling 
balancing between efficiency, agility, and predictability of the 
results quality.</p>

<p>Finally, we have learned that there are generic software engineering 
techniques that can be applied in many domains, but due to the 
domain-specific differences in characteristics, it is also useful to adapt, 
enhance and possibly create domain-specific techniques, tools, methods, 
frameworks, etc. This brings us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong><em>Recommendation 8</em></strong>: Establish <em>research software engineering 
research</em> as a research field over RSE.</li>
</ul>

<p>RSE research will probably keep us busy for a number of years as a 
foundational field of research, which obviously is to be executed by SE 
researchers and not so much by the domain researchers themselves.</p>
