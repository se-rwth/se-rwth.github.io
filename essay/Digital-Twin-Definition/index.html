    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>digital twin</strong> of an original system is a software that consists of</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a set of models of the system and</li>
      <li>a set of digital shadows, both of which are purposefully 
updated on a regular basis, and</li>
      <li>provides a set of services to use both purposefully 
with respect to the original system.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The digital twin interacts with the original system by</p>
    <ul>
      <li>providing useful information about the system’s context and</li>
      <li>sending it control commands.</li>
    </ul>

  
</div>

<h5 id="rationale-for-this-definition-of-a-digital-twin"><em>Rationale for this Definition of a Digital Twin</em></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We originally published in <a href="#DMR+20">[DMR+20]</a> a first version but 
updated it to this version after discussions on a 
<a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=22362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dagstuhl seminar on DTs</a>
and further meetings, such as the Modellierung’23.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because digital twins (DT) are currently a hot topic that promises a 
variety of improvements for the development and operations of physical 
systems, there are also a lot of different definitions. We felt it 
necessary to come up with the above definition to clarify our 
understanding of DTs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One major difference is that we do not only understand DT as a 
virtual decal of the physical system during development but also as a 
software system that actively accompanies the physical system during its 
operation. The digital twin collects, keeps, aggregates, and uses 
data in the form of digital shadows and it provides useful 
information and forms of active software services to users and 
connects with other systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We use the term “original system” in a wider sense, not only 
focusing on physical, engineered systems but also including natural 
systems, biological systems, civil structures, and (immaterial) 
processes or workflows executed by humans, robots, and/or computers. 
We can also envision use cases 
for a digital twin of a pure software system. Note, we sometimes also 
use the commonly applied terms “physical twin”, “physical system”, or 
“actual system” instead of “original system”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>“digital companion”</strong> is actually a very good name for what we 
envision. It is used only in medicine for the digital twin of a 
human being (i.e. the patients).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A digital twin needs to know many things about its physical 
twin. This form of information can only be provided when the 
engineering documents, that means the development models, can be reused and 
transformed into a productive digital twin. For example, a structure 
model helps to understand where sensors are located and thus provides 
the meta-information for the sensor data in the digital shadows. We 
thus explicitly added models as constituents for digital twins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, digital twins share some characteristics with 
models. Below, we take a deeper look at the similarities and differences 
between these two constructs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The physical twin may actively or passively evolve its structure 
over time, e.g., failing components are 
replaced, extensions are added, etc. This typically also needs the 
update of the models describing the physical twin. These kinds of 
updates will be rare but may happen.
However, the old models may then be kept as well, which leads to a 
versioned description of the physical system. 
Furthermore, the digital twin may assist in evolutionary adaptations
of the physical twin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The digital shadows are either continuously extended or 
new ones are permanently created while 
the system is operating. Therefore, the digital shadows are<br>
updated either on each event (event-based), or on a fixed or dynamically 
adaptable timescale (measurements). This information flow
introduces some delay, which 
in most cases must be below a certain (clearly defined) threshold
and is very purpose-dependent. 
Updating can be done manually or automatically, using various 
sub-storage and transmission techniques.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communication is bidirectional, allowing, e.g., to send various
forms of information about the systems context including 
other systems to the
physical system. For example, an autonomous car may receive traffic
information, weather, etc., and production engines may receive 
expected humidity or logistical information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along the communication lines to the physical system, the DT
may also send various forms of control commands, from configurations
up to hard real-time execution commands, if the overall system is 
designed to enable this.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>digital shadow</strong> includes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a set of contextual data traces and/or</li>
      <li>their aggregation and abstraction collected concerning a
system for a specific purpose with respect to the original
system.</li>
    </ul>

</div>

<h5 id="rationale-for-this-definition-of-a-digital-shadow"><em>Rationale for this Definition of a Digital Shadow</em></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A digital shadow is obviously a set of data that was collected during 
the operation of the original system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To keep the connection with the original system, augmentation with 
various forms of meta-data is obviously necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When looking at the amount of data available over time (for example, 
through audio, radar, camera), it is obvious that various forms of 
aggregation and abstraction are useful to keep the data manageable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because digital shadows have a purpose and do not necessary 
know that purpose upfront, it might make sense to keep data in various 
forms of abstractions available. E.g., The original high-resolution 
camera picture versus only the number and kind of objects currently 
seen on that picture, or only the difference to a previous situation, 
etc.</p>
  </li>

    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Digital Twin Cockpit (DTC) </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A digital twin cockpit is the user interaction part
(UI/GUI) of a digital twin.</p>

    <p>(originally published in <a href="#BMR+22">[BMR+22]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<h5 id="rationale-for-this-definition-of-a-digital-twin-cockpit-dtc"><em>Rationale for this Definition of a Digital Twin Cockpit (DTC)</em></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Above, we have argued that a digital twin has an important role during 
the operation of the original physical system. The digital twin knows 
the current state as well as history in form of digital shadows and thus 
naturally is the primary information source for any form of neighboring 
systems, but especially human users. The DT thus needs a comfortable 
user interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The digital twin cockpit provides the <strong>graphical user interface for 
visualizations</strong> of its data organized in digital shadows and models 
and the interaction with services of the digital twin, and thus enables 
humans to 
access, 
adapt and 
add information, 
monitor, and 
partially control the physical system.  (from <a href="#BMR+22">[BMR+22]</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cockpit is, by definition, a part of the digital twin and can be 
seen both as a special service provided by the digital twin and as an 
integrative front-end component for various specific services that the 
digital twin provides.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cockpit visualizes various forms of data, which includes, e.g., 
digital shadows, any form of data received from third-party systems, 
all kinds of data and commands entered by the humans using the cockpit, 
and models of the physical system or the operation processes of the 
physical system. This includes geometric visualizations, schematic, 
diagramatic and tabular visualizations and forms of virtual reality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, dependent on the form and use cases of the original 
system, as well as the use cases of the digital twin, the cockpit may 
have various different forms. In particular, services may assist 
complex processes involving the physical system, the digital twin, and 
the human users interacting in various forms. A Process-Aware Digital 
Twin Cockpit (PADTC) is thus especially interesting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional forms of DTC and especially PADTC may be based on screen 
and keybord, but virtual reality and especially <em>augmented reality</em> 
also seems a promising approach. In particular may a Metaverse be 
understood as a ecosystem populated with digital twins, i.e. avatars of 
humans and replicas of buildings and other physical systems.</p>

<h3 id="detailed-explanation-for-the-digital-twin-definition">Detailed Explanation for the Digital Twin Definition</h3>

<p><strong>A DT is not a model.</strong>
However, DT and models share a lot of characteristics. A DT has a 
purpose with respect to the original (i.e., the system) and it 
contains a lot of knowledge about the system. 
A DT, therefore, contains one or a set of models of the physical 
system.</p>

<p><strong>A DT is not identical (isomorphic) to the physical system.</strong> 
While twins in the 
real world have the same origin and share, therefore, a lot of 
characteristics, twins are also not identical in the real world.</p>
<ul>
  <li>DT is digital: digitalization in itself means that something physical 
is represented by a non-physical, pure software-based entity. Product and 
DT can, therefore, not be confused with each other.</li>
  <li>Digitalization also means that the DT is an abstraction. A digital 
version of an analogous product or picture is always an abstraction, no 
matter how detailed it is.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A DT provides services.</strong> These services are active and thus realized 
by software. They are part of a 
digital system consisting of a state, e.g., a database, algorithms, and 
usually also a graphical user interface to interact with human operators. 
The services of the DT may thus be used by other digital systems or 
by humans.</p>

<p><strong>The Digital Twin can change the behavior of the physical system.</strong>
That means the DT can control the the original system, at least to the
extent where this strategic, tactic or real-time control is feasible.</p>

<p><strong>The DT contains a set of models.</strong> These models are typically either (1) 
derived from engineering models, (2) directly the engineering models, 
or (3) derived as abstractions from the data traces collected over time 
of operation.</p>

<p><strong>The DT has a purpose with respect to the original system.</strong> This 
characteristic is shared with the definition of models. Quite a variety 
of purposes of the DT can be thought of.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The DT can, for example, be used to analyze, optimize, simulate, and 
predict behavior throughout the complete lifecycle of a physical 
system.</li>
  <li>The DT can be used to understand the behavior of the system, as well 
as the context it is operating in, in which state it is during 
development, in which mode it is during operation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The DT contains sets of digital shadows.</strong> A digital shadow is itself 
a passive data trace or an abstraction of it. A DT may collect more 
data traces over time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>While the DS is passive, the DT contains all relevant functionalities 
(algorithms), storage, and retrieval to actually perform the 
abstractions and aggregations.</li>
  <li>The DT provides services that use a set of functionalities to 
visualize and otherwise analyze the collected DS.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To execute its services, the DT connects the data traces with the 
engineering models such that the databases become meaningful.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>e.g., the models describe actual and virtual sensor points of the system 
and the data traces describe the values collected by these sensors.</li>
  <li>Sensors, in a broad sense, can be automatic (e.g., the temperature of 
the system), input by humans (descriptions, modes), or measurements by 
external, temporary sensors.</li>
  <li>The DT uses (real-time) data traces and (design-time) models 
for visualization and various forms of analysis, to 
enable learning, reasoning, dynamically recalibrating or self-adapting 
its and the systems behavior, as well as assistance for improved decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kinds-of-digital-twins-development-usage-operation">Kinds of Digital Twins: Development, Usage (Operation)</h3>

<p>Depending on the purpose, there are different kinds of digital twins. 
The following list elaborates some main types of DTs without assuming 
this list is complete:</p>

<p><strong>“Development Digital Twin”</strong> is a central part of the development 
process. It contains a coherent set of development artifacts, which 
describe the system under development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>These development artifacts are typically models of various 
viewpoints and in various abstractions, describing the structure, 
behavior, 
interactions, decomposition forms, geometry, functionality (both 
mechanical and computational), requirements, design decisions, 
architecture, etc.</li>
  <li>The development DT may also contain assembly plans (mechanical) and 
build procedures (IT).</li>
  <li>The development DT may also contain information about the development 
process, which consists of tasks, planned and executed iterations, 
artifact states, milestones in traditional processes, scrums in agile 
processes, etc.</li>
  <li>A development DT could consist of informal documents with textual 
descriptions, but using a model-based development process is probably 
more efficient.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“Usage Digital Twin”</strong> is a set of services that helps the owner, 
respectively the user of a system, to understand the current state 
and the 
history as much as possible and potentially also to plan future actions 
during the operation phase of a system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>E.g., a car DT mainly deals with information that is relevant to 
users, drivers, and potentially fleet owners, such as gas filling, next 
time to service, customization of the display, e.g., with additional 
services, managing the navigation system, etc.</li>
  <li>A production line DT deals with maintenance and production 
information for the current workers as well as the management.</li>
  <li>If the usage DT also influences the system itself, then one 
could also speak of a <strong>“Controlling Digital Twin”</strong>. To enable 
control, a feedback channel to the system is needed, allowing for
adapting its behavior according to certain given restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“Diagnostic Digital Twin”</strong> is a set of services that helps 
maintenance to understand the state of operation, failures, and repair 
operations. This includes remote diagnostics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A car diagnostic DT, in all its features, is used during maintenance 
and could typically be equipped with additional tooling to execute 
detailed diagnostics and repair operations.</li>
  <li>Diagnostic DTs may also be of interest to the manufacturer.</li>
  <li>In a production line, usage and diagnostic DT may coincide (or even 
more variants of them may exist).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“Autonomous Collaboration DT”</strong> is an active set of services that 
connects itself with other DTs of this type to collaborate on achieving 
certain functionality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Autonomous Collaboration DT acts like an autonomous agent, needs 
to understand its context in sufficient detail, and reacts to 
changing environment robustly. Example: collaborative autonomous 
driving.</li>
  <li>The Autonomous Collaboration DT also has the ability to control the 
underlying system. If a fleet (set) of systems shall act together and 
in a sufficiently synchronized and reliable way, then the fleet (set) 
of Autonomous Collaboration DT coordinates this reliably.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“Monitoring DT”</strong> is a set of services that collects relevant data 
traces and proofs correct behavior versus certain juristic and 
technical restrictions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A monitoring DT, e.g., traces whenever a rented car has not left the 
official rental area, a production engine wasn’t operated outside its 
parameters, etc.</li>
  <li>A monitoring DT may, e.g., be used by owners, insurances, etc.</li>
  <li>Airplanes, e.g., are equipped with (not yet connected) black boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“Business DT”</strong> is used by the owner or manufacturer to understand 
the past, current, and future financial conditions of the operation of 
a system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This may include the capacity utilization of a fleet of rental cars 
or the degeneration and replacement conditions of spare parts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“Production DT”</strong> is used by the manufacturer during the production 
or assembly of a product to understand its state, respectively, the 
states of all its components.</p>

<p>Remarks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The development DT has the characteristics of a “type” because it 
may have a lot of instances (real systems built). It, therefore, also 
does not have data traces, except potentially from simulations used 
during development.</li>
  <li>All other kinds of DTs are based on concrete instances of the 
product. They can share runtime data in the form of data traces, which 
are unique to the concrete product.</li>
  <li>Thus, the development DT and all other DTs significantly differ in 
use and 
offered services, even though it may be that an extraction/derivation 
of the development DT is needed in the other DTs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-twin-and-cyber-physical-systems-cps">Digital Twin and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</h3>

<p>A useful definition: <strong>Cyber-physical systems</strong> (CPS) are engineered 
systems where functionalities are emerging from the networked 
interaction of physical and computational processes. <a href="#BDS19">[BDS19]</a></p>

<p>The boundary between CPS and digital twin is blurred since a CPS 
already contains software.</p>

<p><strong>The DT can be considered a logical unit.</strong> This means that the 
services of the DT may 
be executed by many computational units (Hardware, CPUs), can be distributed, 
virtualized, and increasingly often lives partially in a cloud. 
Parts of the logical DT may be very close or even in the physical
system and, thus, include edge computing techniques.
If there exist other software systems in parallel to the DT, such as 
SAP 
management components, the DT can communicate with those. 
The times when DT and the CPS exist should largely overlap. The DT 
may start its existence already at the production of the CPS and
survive the CPS to still provide data about it.</p>

<p><strong>Logically, there is only one digital twin.</strong> If there were 
several twins, they would not be twins but triplets or more.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If two digital siblings tried to control one physical twin, that 
could become complicated.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Logically, each CPS has a digital twin on its own.</strong> But digital 
twins of several CPS may</p>
<ul>
  <li>share data, e.g., for reasons of learning from each other</li>
  <li>exchange certain information for cooperation  (which actually means 
they are composed)</li>
  <li>share the same implementing system (platform, software) or even the 
same engineering models because they originate from the same 
development project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="further-remarks-on-digital-twins">Further Remarks on Digital Twins</h3>

<p><strong>The DT is always the DT of an original.</strong>  The definition mainly 
applies to the DTs of systems, which includes cars, production, medical 
devices, buildings, and even city quarters, but not processes, nor 
humans or things occurring in nature, although adaptions could be 
easily possible.</p>
<ul>
  <li>E.g., the digital twin of a human could be of interest in society, 
medical, or also industrial context, e.g., describing capabilities, 
workload, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>A conceptually well-defined digital twin can be technically distributed 
over a set of nodes, including the system, local devices (edge 
computers), and the cloud.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This induces engineering challenges but needs to be tackled in order to
fully use available computation and communication infrastructures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the services of a DT are intensively connected to the 
functional capabilities of the physical system, it may well be that the 
<strong>development process has to concentrate on the physical system and digital 
twin in parallel</strong>. The digital twin, therefore, is NOT only a spin-off 
product of the development of the physical system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We speak of a <strong>“product service system”</strong> as the integrated, holistic 
system consisting of the physical product and the associated services 
that are available through its digital twin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the system may be configurable, can be <strong>parameterized or 
calibrated</strong> and new services may be coming over time, the DT might be 
<strong>highly “self-adaptive”</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>“Models@Runtime”</strong>, which here means, the explicit management of models 
in a digital twin allows for connecting sources of data traces to 
the system’s models while the system and the DT is in operation (“running”).</p>

<p>“Models@Runtime” also provide a highly customizable and, therefore, 
adaptive mechanism. Adaptivity through explicit models provides another 
set of engineering challenges.</p>

<p>We distinguish three different main forms of adaptation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Autonomous self-adaptation, e.g., induced by changes in the environment, 
 optimizations identified, for example, through continuous measurements 
 or by slow degradation of the system itself.</li>
  <li>The user wishes to adapt the system behavior.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer adapts the system behavior according to identified 
 optimizations, fixing of bugs and failures, changes of juristical 
 side conditions, or upgrades of functionality.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Managing “Models@Runtime” enforces additional infrastructure</strong>, such 
as appropriate meta-models or explicit system and self-monitoring.</p>

<p>Parts of the “Models@Runtime” may be physically embedded within the 
system to achieve appropriate performance and reliability. Others may 
be hosted externally (e.g., in the cloud).</p>

<p>Complex systems are decomposed.</p>

<p>Individual subsystems or components of the systems</p>
<ol>
  <li>may have an individual history,</li>
  <li>are developed in the individual sub-projects, potentially 
even outsourced to suppliers,</li>
  <li>may be reused from predefined sets of available components, or</li>
  <li>may be replaced over time. 
Therefore, <strong>the DT should be “structurally composed” similarly and in 
accordance with the product</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to the product that only knows its current state, the DT 
should know about all historical structural changes and replacements.</p>

<div class="row" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

    </div>
</div>

<p>The DT, therefore, has to cope with several <strong>dimensions of variability</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>replacements of subcomponents,</li>
  <li>recalibration and change of parameters of operation of the system,</li>
  <li>change of available services and service-variants, and</li>
  <li>deviations of the engineered system from the produced system. 
These dimensions of variability all exist in addition to the typical 
engineering variability of different variants of systems.</li>
</ol>
