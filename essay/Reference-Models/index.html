<h3 id="why-reference-models">Why Reference Models?</h3>

<p>In many discussions and publications, we recognize the use of the term 
“<strong>reference model</strong>”.
There are “technical reference models”, “business reference models”,
the “ISO/OSE 7 layer communication reference model”, 
“enterprise architecture reference models”, “performance reference models”,
and many more.
Occasionally even meta-models seem to be used as reference models.</p>

<p>In <a href="#GR21d">[GR21d]</a>, we have raised the question of whether
it is possible to leverage this notion of a reference model.
In particular:</p>

<p>How can the notion of a
reference model, explicitly denoted in a given modeling
language, be formalized together with a precisely defined
and tool-assisted notion of a conformance relation that
would enable concrete realizations of the reference model?</p>

<p>And here would like to give some comments on this discussion.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h3 id="reference-model-in-the-common-literature">Reference Model in the Common Literature</h3>

<p>The definition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Wikipedia]</a>
is (as of Sept. 2022):
<em>“A reference model—in systems,
    enterprise, and software engineering—is an abstract
    framework or domain-specific ontology consisting of an
    interlinked set of clearly defined concepts produced by an
    expert or body of experts to encourage clear communication.
    A reference model can represent the component parts of any
    consistent idea, from business functions to system
    components, as long as it represents a complete set. This
    frame of reference can then be used to communicate ideas
    clearly among members of the same community.”</em></p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="critics-on-the-above-definition-of-reference-model">Critics on the above Definition of Reference Model</h5>

<p>In full consideration, we are not completely satisfied with this
definition. Firstly, even a reference model is a “model.”
According to our understanding of the <strong>general definition of
“model”</strong> (which is based on Stachowiak <a href="#Sta73">[Sta73]</a>,</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) there should
  be an original, real system/entity that is being modeled,</li>
  <li>(2) the model should be an abstraction of the original, and</li>
  <li>(3) the model has something to do with the original system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Secondly, in the definition, the term “reference model” shares a lot 
of similarities to “conceptual model” and “ontology”, which should 
probably be distinguishable. Third, the reference model “represents a 
complete set”, without clarifying what representation or completeness 
in this context is.</p>

<p>We draw the following consequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(C1) A model can be <strong>used as a substitution</strong> for
the real system: The <strong>Principle of Substitution</strong> then applies 
to reference models as well. It states that a
useful subset of questions about the original can be answered by
querying the model. This seems to fit the definition of a reference 
model because such a model should be a reference
for many (similar) systems, even though there is typically
a concretization development step between the definition of
the reference model and the finalization of the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(C2) A model is usually defined <strong>explicitly in 
an appropriate modeling 
language</strong>. For example, if we design a
reference model for some data standard, we can use class diagrams as 
a language for its expression.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(C3) It is
often feasible to <strong>use a similar or the same 
language for both reference and
concrete models</strong>, even though sometimes specific language
constructs may only be used in the reference model, respectively, the
concrete model. – This may be a restriction for the general notion 
of the reference model because, in principle, it might be possible to actually 
use different modeling languages for reference models and their concrete 
realizations, but we ignore this possibility for now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(C4) As a consequence, it is often not easy to recognize a reference
model from the concrete realizations that are possible.
It may be that the same model may serve as concrete model or as reference 
model in different contexts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(C5) Given a concrete model that is used for realization within
a concrete system, it must be clearly decidable whether and
how far the <strong>concrete model actually conforms to the reference model</strong>. 
A somewhat unclear conformance relation is not necessarily a problem when the
reference model serves education, communication, or an
otherwise informal purpose.
However, when there is <strong>tool assistance</strong> available or needed, 
the question of 
whether a concrete model conforms to its reference
becomes more critical. When the <strong>reference model is defined from 
a legal or standard context</strong>, the conformance
question also becomes relevant for <strong>certification</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While the word “reference model” is used quite frequently,
to our understanding, many domains and their communities
have different and mostly informal understandings of the significance 
of a reference model and, consequently, different
approaches to using reference models in a particular domain.</p>

<p>We posit that a more concise and formal understanding of
the concept of a reference model is needed that
improves the tool-assisted relationship between a general
“reference model” and the set of concrete realizations that
conform to that reference model.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Reference Model </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>reference model</strong> 
    in systems, enterprise, and software engineering is</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a model in a given language</li>
      <li>used to describe a set of domain concepts and their
domain-specific relations and</li>
      <li>is equipped with a <strong>conformance relation</strong> that precisely
identifies the set of conforming models within the same
language.</li>

<h5 id="rationale-for-this-definition-of-a-reference-model"><em>Rationale for this Definition of a Reference Model</em></h5>

<p>To some extent, we have given the rationale already in the motivation above.
Here are additional arguments.</p>

<p>The main difference between a reference model and a concrete model
is not purely a syntactical issue but based on the purpose of the model.
Or to be more precise on the multiple purposes in the various activities of a 
development process. We identify these main purposes for reference models,
where not all purposes must be addressed with each model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(P1) The introduction of <strong>domain concepts</strong> (which itself 
  could be regarded as a fuzzy term). We assume that a
  domain concept has a name and potentially a number of properties that,
  together, can somehow be represented in our modeling language.
  These domain concepts are (and this is again somewhat informal) 
  of general interest and, thus, typically also can be regarded as
  elements of a glossary or an ontology of a certain domain.</li>
  <li>(P2) <strong>Domain-specific relations</strong> connect these domain concepts.
  These relations are also described in the reference model.</li>
  <li>(P3) The <strong>reference model itself</strong> usually also has a name and, thus, allows 
  us to talk about the overall system structure.</li>
  <li>(P4) There is <strong>additional information</strong> or <strong>methodical development advice</strong> 
  available that fits the domain concepts and, thus, can be manually reused
  in a development process.</li>
  <li>(P5) There is a <strong>predefined implementation</strong> available 
  that fits the domain concepts and, thus, can be automatically
  reused directly or mapped to the concrete model and its implementation
  via smart tooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>(P1) and (P2) are usually the case in data models describing the 
application data of a domain, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Account</code>, and their 
relation, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owns</code>. (P3) is, e.g., the case in the ISO/OSE 7 Layer 
Communication model or in various Design Patterns. 
Another example is a traffic light model
with two states, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red</code>, and the according 
transitions between those states as a reference model 
probably serves all three purposes (P1-3), if refinable, e.g., to 
traffic lights with third state <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yellow</code>.</p>

<p>Using reference models, however, becomes really interesting if (P4) 
or even (P5) can be leveraged.
In adequate tooling, for example, the concept <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> may be equipped with 
possibilities for a user to administrate her own setting, acquire roles, receive 
rights to read/write data, etc.</p>

<p>It all depends on the conformance relation and the tooling that 
(a) checks conformance and (b) has smart ideas on how to transfer 
predefined functionality from the reference model to the concrete
model, respectively, its implementation.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Conformance Relation between Reference Model and Concrete Model </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>The <strong>conformance relation</strong> between two models <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code></p>

    <ul>
      <li>is a binary, reflexive, transitive relation that</li>
      <li>describes whether concrete model <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is a concretization of 
reference model <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>.</li>
    </ul>

  
</div>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="rationale-for-this-definition-of-the-conformance-relation"><em>Rationale for this Definition of the Conformance Relation</em></h5>

<p>The conformance relation is defined as a binary relation because, in 
practice, we only need to look at the reference model describing 
relevant concepts and its implementation, respectively, the concrete 
system model describing the implementation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>(CR1) The conformance relation generally relates more abstract models 
  with more concrete models.</li>
  <li>(CR2) Because the reference model and concrete model belong to the same 
  language, we may accept that a reference model can also be a concrete 
  implementation, which means conformance is <strong>reflexive</strong>. 
  Transitivity is probably not an important property for the conformance 
  relation, but (in the tradition of mathematical properties), we find it 
  a pretty clean approach when conformance can be applied 
  <strong>transitively</strong>. It, however, is also relatively clear that the 
  conformance relation is not symmetric but relates the more abstract to 
  the more concrete models. But it may be that it is not fully asymmetric 
  either.</li>
  <li>(CR3) As a consequence, the sets of reference models and concrete 
  models of language are not disjoint but may have a large overlap.
  However, they don’t necessarily have to be identical, i.e., there may be 
  models that only can be used as reference models (e.g., because certain 
  abstract concepts (e.g., abstract classes) in the models do not have
  concretizations yet).</li>
</ul>

<p>In a development project that uses a reference model, the conformance 
relation is potentially a development artifact on its own. It may even 
be that it is necessary to explicitly write down a <strong>mapping</strong> to 
connect abstract domain concepts of the reference model with concrete 
realization concepts in the concrete model. These kinds of mappings may 
be of complex forms, and it could well be that there is no generalized form
for all purposes. 
However, we expect at least the following property to hold</p>

<ul>
  <li>(CR4) The conformance relation between abstract and concrete models 
can be effectively checked by an algorithm. This must hold in both cases, 
(CR4.1), where the mapping can be constructed automatically from two given 
models, and (CR4.2), where the mapping is explicitly given as some kind of 
parameter of the conformance relation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that we do not enforce that a reference model describes a 
structure, such as a data structure or a communication infrastructure. 
We can perfectly understand that people use Statecharts, BPMN 
models, Petri Nets, or activity diagrams as reference models. 
Furthermore, it may well be that a domain-specific language created 
for a specific purpose also comes along with the construct of reference 
models within the language.</p>

<p>However, we assume that the construction of reference models 
and, in particular, the conformance relation needed is highly driven
by the semantics of the particular language and, thus, a general,
purely syntax-based conformance relation will not be sufficient.
As a consequence, conformance relations need to be defined for
modeling languages individually.</p>

<h3 id="reference-models-for-data-using-the-class-diagram-language">Reference Models for Data (using the Class Diagram Language)</h3>

<p>Let us explain a possible conformance relation for class diagrams as 
known from the UML <a href="#Rum17">[Rum17]</a> using an example. 
As usual, a class 
diagram has classes, interfaces, enumerations, attributes, methods, 
constants, and binary associations and compositions of various forms.
Consider the following 
class diagram in textual form, i.e., a model of 
<a href="https://github.com/MontiCore/cd4analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MontiCore’s CD4A language</a>,
which we regard as a reference model:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// reference model                              as CD4A model
classdiagram AccessRights {
  class User;
  class Role;
  class Permission;
  class Create extends Permission;
  class Update extends Permission;
  association userroles User -&gt; Role [*];
  association Role -&gt; Permission [*];
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A realization could be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// concrete model                              as CD4A model
classdiagram Flensburg {
  class Person;
  class Admin;
  class CarOwner;
  association Person -&gt; Admin [0..1];
  association myCars   Person -&gt; CarOwnerRole [*];
  class Permission;
  class CreateCar extends Permission;
  class UpdateCar extends Permission;
  association allowed  [1] CarOwnerRole &lt;-&gt; Permission [1..3];
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For clarification, we talk about <em>concrete classes</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> and <em>concrete 
associations</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> when referring to the <em>concrete model</em> and <em>reference 
classes</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>, <em>reference association</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code>, etc. when referring to the <em>reference 
model</em>. We regard concrete elements as <em>incarnated</em> reference elements.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to clarify that the term “<em>incarnation</em>” shares some
characteristics of “instantiation”, but there are
also substantial differences: (1) Incarnation relates models elements 
of the same kind, here classes with classes and associations with associations,
while instantiation normally relates different kinds, e.g., objects with classes.
(2) Incarnation is transitive and reflexive 
on the model elements (similar to the conformance relation
on models itself), while instantiation is not.</p>

<p>A conformation relation between the above models can (informally) be defined as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// list of incarnations for model elements                     (informal)
  Person                                       ===&gt;  User
  Admin, CarOwner                              ===&gt;  Role
  Permission, CreateCar, UpdateCar             ===&gt;  Permission
  (Person -&gt; Admin), (Person -&gt; CarOwnerRole)  ===&gt;  userroles
  allowed                                      ===&gt;  (Role -&gt; Permission)
</code></pre></div></div>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="requirements-on-conformance-relations">Requirements on Conformance Relations</h5>

<p>We can argue that the above model <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Flensburg</code> is a conforming 
implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AccessRights</code> when using the incarnation mapping given here. 
It does have a 
number of specialities, which are worthwhile discussing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(R1) A concrete class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> incarnates (at most) one reference class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>
      (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> incarnates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code>).
      In general, it is also possible that additional new classes
      exist in the concrete model.</li>
  <li>(R2) The same reference class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> may be incarnated by many concrete classes
      (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Role</code> by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Admin, CarOwner</code>).</li>
  <li>(R3) Subclassing relations are preserved, i.e., the
     concrete class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C2 extends C1</code> exactly if their reference classes
     <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R2 extends R1</code>. Class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C2</code>need not necessarily be a direct subclass
     but can be found in the subclassing hierarchy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C1</code>.</li>
  <li>(R4) A concrete association <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> incarnates (at most) one reference association <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code>
      (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allowed</code> incarnates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(Role -&gt; Permission)</code>).
      Again it is possible that additional associations exist in the 
      concrete model.</li>
  <li>(R5) In analogy to classes, the same reference association <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code>
     may be incarnated by many concrete associations.
      (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userroles</code> has two independent incarnations).</li>
  <li>(R6) Reference associations are preserved. That means given concrete 
      classes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C2</code>, their reference classes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R2</code>,
      and a reference association <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S: R1 -&gt; R2</code>, then
      there must also be a concrete association <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A: C1 -&gt; C2</code>, such that
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> incarnates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code>
      (in our example all concrete classes have respective concrete associations 
       attached
       except the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Admin</code>, which violates this condition.
       We could argue that admin doesn’t need explicit permissions because,
       in our application, she has all permissions anyway, but it does 
       violate the conformance rule).</li>
</ul>

<p>The above example is only an abstract example. The really interesting part is 
the transfer of an also existing standard implementation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AccessRights</code>, either in 
the form of a methodological approach, a framework, or even a generator 
that adds all the technical details, such as rights management, 
database storage, etc., for such a reference model. 
<strong>The applicable conformance relation normally depends on the available standard 
implementation or, respectively, the generator functionality</strong>. Or in other 
words: even if a general conformance relation is available, it may be 
that concrete usage has to restrict the conformance relation according 
to specific needs or may relax it with certain respects.</p>

<p>[<a href="#NRSS22">[NRSS22]</a>, <a href="#MRR11b">[MRR11b]</a> provides <em>semantic differencing</em> 
as an advanced analysis technique to understand the differences between two 
class diagrams on the basis of the actual object structures that are 
allowed in one but not the other model. 
This kind of semantic difference uses identical class, attribute, and 
association names to identify
comparable classes. Semantic differencing, however, can be extended to
reference models and their incarnations to understand 
the differences between the concrete realization and the original 
reference model when incorporating the conformance relation
into the semantic difference calculation.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="variants-of-conformance-relations">Variants of Conformance Relations</h5>

<p>Let us give several examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The reference model uses attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">long ident</code> 
as an internal identification mechanism. It may be allowed to 
incarnate that attribute by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String ident</code>, because strings also have a linear 
order or by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int id</code> because we know that the reduced range is sufficient.
In case a framework implementation, however, already relies on data type
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">long</code>, such a change would be illegal.</li>
  <li>The reference model uses a certain cardinality for association
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S: C1 -&gt; C2 [card]</code>. Cardinality can, in principle, be restricted
because we know from the domain that certain restrictions are okay or 
extended, e.g., from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[1]</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[*]</code>, because that is needed in the domain.
It may be that both changes are okay, or neither of them.</li>
  <li>The reference model has a direct subclass relationship between classes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R1</code> and subclass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R2</code>. In the concrete model, there may be many 
incarnations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R2</code> arranged in a deep hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, it may be that adding additional attributes or associations 
is restricted because there are predefined implementations (or 
predefined generative techniques) of certain reference classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Potentially there are many more details to be handled, such as
freely choosable independent names or attribute types, how to deal with
enumerations, what are valid or necessary incarnations of interfaces 
and abstract classes, etc. 
Ane specifically interesting question is, for example, whether a 
reference attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> or a reference association <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code> can be incarnated in the 
concrete model by a derived attribute or a composed association.
In both cases, the realization is hidden in the combination of data 
structure and algorithmic functionality, such as getters 
with calculation bodies for 
derived attributes or an OCL-like logic formula describing how to derive a
composed association from basic ones.</p>

<p>To summarize, we would argue that there is no such thing as one single
conformance relation even for class diagrams, but there may be a core,
as shown in the requirements (R1) to (R6), plus a number of
additional or optional relaxations, who are, however, dependent
on the actually available tooling behind the reference model
and therefore need to be defined together with the reference model.</p>

<p>When looking at other kinds of languages, for example, Statecharts, 
the very same observations apply. There we have to map states, 
transitions, nesting of states, preconditions, entry and exit actions, 
etc. Preconditions may, for example, be relaxed or strengthened, or 
alternative transitions in nondeterministic Statecharts may be 
removed. A simulation relation for Statecharts or, more precisely, a 
refinement calculus like in <a href="#Rum96">[Rum96]</a> or <a href="#PR94">[PR94]</a>
could be applied here. 
Especially challenging is the question of whether a reference 
transition may be realized by a sequence of concrete transitions and 
what happens if the sequence can be interrupted in the middle.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="representations-of-the-conformance-relation-mapping">Representations of the Conformance Relation Mapping</h5>

<p>An interesting question is what an explicit representation 
for a conformance relation looks like if needed. Above, we have given an informal 
list to describe this mapping. The list contains explicitly given names 
for classes and associations but also maps unnamed associations by 
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(C1 -&gt; C2)</code> notation.</p>

<p>We actually see several options for dealing with such mappings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(O1) An explicit mapping language similar to the above shown informal 
  artifact can be used.</li>
  <li>(O2) The mapping can be extracted from the two 
  models by using naming conventions.</li>
  <li>(O3) The concrete model explicitly 
  refers to the reference model by using the domain concepts introduced in the 
  reference model as stereotypes, labels, or flags.</li>
  <li>(O4) The concrete 
  model is actually an extension of the reference model, which means that 
  all model elements (here, classes and associations) 
  defined in the reference model are 
  explicitly included and therefore used in the concrete model.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="conformance-relation-when-using-a-framework">Conformance Relation when using a Framework</h5>

<p>Option (O4) is quite common, especially if the reference model has a
framework implementation, where the classes of the reference model are 
already and explicitly implemented under the very same names.
Using different names is then not a possibility. 
The concrete model then would then have to be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// concrete model as extension                          as CD4A model
classdiagram Flensburg extends AccessRights {
  class Person extends User;
  class Admin extends Role;
  class CarOwner extends Role;
  class CreateCar extends Permission;
  class UpdateCar extends Permission;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This model is relatively compact because associations need not be
mentioned explicitly again but are inherited from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AccessRights</code>.
However, this approach does neither allow for adapting 
cardinalities of associations nor building multiple incarnations of associations.</p>

<p>A similar approach could be to develop the concrete model independently 
at first and then apply a generalized merge algorithm, similar to
the one provided by 
<a href="https://github.com/MontiCore/cd4analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MontiCore’s CD4A language</a>,
and merge the framework classes, associations, and, thus, infrastructure
into the concrete model.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<h5 id="conformance-relation-when-using-a-flexible-generator">Conformance Relation when using a flexible Generator</h5>

<p>If a generator is available (O3), then a feasible and, therefore, also quite 
common alternative would be to label the concrete model elements like 
in the following example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// concrete model using stereotypes                      as CD4A model 
classdiagram &lt;&lt;labels:"AccessRights"&gt;&gt; Flensburg { 
  class &lt;&lt;User&gt;&gt; Person;
  class &lt;&lt;Role&gt;&gt; Admin;
  class &lt;&lt;Role&gt;&gt; CarOwner;
  association &lt;&lt;userroles&gt;&gt; Person -&gt; Admin [0..1];
  association &lt;&lt;userroles&gt;&gt; myCars   Person -&gt; CarOwnerRole [*];
  class Permission;
  class &lt;&lt;Create&gt;&gt; CreateCar extends Permission;
  class &lt;&lt;Update&gt;&gt; UpdateCar extends Permission;
  association allowed  [1] CarOwnerRole &lt;-&gt; Permission [1..3];
} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here a lot of stereotypes pollute the otherwise clean analysis model. 
Using a number of conventions, it may be that certain labels have not 
been defined explicitly but can be reconstructed. This is regularly 
the case for a concrete association when both its concrete classes 
have been stereotyped.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to combine the explicit labeling with the 
implicit use of naming conventions, as described in Option (O2), such 
as (1) same name (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Permission</code>), or (2) a shared prefix (see 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UpdateCar</code>) or analogously a shared postfix (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StopState</code>). This, 
of course, shares the problem of unwanted, coincidental matches 
but largely reduces the amount of labeling 
necessary. This is a common approach when applying design patterns, 
which we also regard as a special form of reference models
denoted as class diagrams, e.g., in <a href="#GHJV95">[GHJV95]</a>,
where often the roles of the individually participating classes are used as
parts of the actual class names.</p>

<p>To prevent potential pollution with stereotypes from various 
technological spaces, we have in <a href="#GLRR15">[GLRR15]</a> explored the 
possibility of using an extra tagging language that allows 
labeling model elements without invasively changing the original model 
stored in extra artifacts. Tagging models can be applied in various domains 
<a href="#DJK+19a">[DJK+19a]</a>, <a href="#MRRW16">[MRRW16]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reference-model-as-ontology">Reference Model as Ontology</h3>

<p>Let us take a slightly different look at reference models:
A reference model defines 
a number of domain concepts, usually with explicit names, which 
actually constitute an ontology (e.g., including a set of terms 
and their relations) within the modeling language. This viewpoint 
enables 
an interesting connection between modeling languages and ontologies,
where the modeling language acts as a carrier for the ontology.
The language provides the modeling elements, and the ontology
provides a library of terms and relations. This is completely compatible 
with the way how natural languages are defined through the grammar
for the syntactic structure and the dictionary for the wording.</p>

<p>Such a connection is obvious for class diagrams, and, thus, we give<br>
different examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encoding a reference model for the behavior of
smartphone apps using a Statechart and realizing specific
apps using a refined number of states in a
concrete Statechart,</li>
  <li>providing a reference model for production and billing
processes using BPMN within a car manufacturer
with country-specific incarnations, and even</li>
  <li>building a (physical or simulated digital) reference model for a factory of 
a manufacturer with the possibility to incarnate this reference model
in various concrete factories around the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wikipedia mentions several uses of reference models,
such as: (1) Creating standards, (2) education,
(3) improving communication between stakeholders, and
(4) facilitating comparison.
A tool-based approach, however, with a clear relationship
between reference and concrete realization model is not 
(yet) included in the Wikipedia definition but should be added when
we are able to provide appropriate tool-assisted cases for reference models.</p>

<p>We are aware that there is already much scientific work on
this topic, but using reference models is by far not where 
it should be.</p>
