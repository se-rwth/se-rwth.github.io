    </p>
<p>A <strong>model</strong> is characterized through three properties:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A model describes some original, real system/entity that exists or is intended to exist in the future.</li>
      <li>A model is an abstraction of the original.</li>
      <li>A model has a purpose with respect to the original.</li>
    </ul>

<p>For a detailed discussion of the possible implications of this definition,
please consult our various publications.
Highlights are, e.g., the discussion on <strong>semantics</strong> of models <a href="#HR04">[HR04]</a>,
the way how to <strong>construct modeling languages</strong>
using the MontiCore language workbench <a href="#HKR21">[HKR21]</a>,
and especially the discussion on <strong>underspecification</strong> as an intrinsic
part of models as opposed to programs <a href="#RW18">[RW18]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="classification-of-model-kinds">Classification of Model Kinds</h3>

<p>Models can be classified in various ways, as shown below, even though
not all classifications are equally relevant.</p>

<h5 id="which-scope-a-model-describes"><strong><em>Which scope a model describes</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>System model</strong> describes the overall system.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Test model</strong> describes one or several tests and is used for testing.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Component model</strong> describes a system component.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Context model</strong> describes the context of a system or component
under consideration. It is not to be confused with “context condition”
introduced below.
The context model is dependent on the scope of the development, 
i.e., which system
components belong to the context. When the scope changes,
e.g., to the next level sub-system, then system components and their models
become context elements.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="which-aspect-of-a-system-a-model-describes"><strong><em>Which aspect of a system a model describes</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Behavior model</strong>, <strong>structure model</strong>,
<strong>architecture model</strong>, <strong>interaction model</strong>,
<strong>state model</strong>, <strong>communication model</strong>, <strong>data model</strong>, etc.,
are models that serve the purpose of describing
a respective aspect of a system or component.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="in-which-development-activityphase-a-model-is-defined-and-used"><strong><em>In which development activity/phase a model is defined and used</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Requirements model</strong>, <strong>functional model</strong>,
<strong>logical model</strong>, <strong>technical model</strong>, and <strong>implementation model</strong>,
but also <strong>architecture model</strong>, <strong>test model</strong>, etc.
are models that are mainly developed and used in the
respective activity of a development project.</li>
  <li>Note that many models are used for other purposes, e.g.,
scientific models or data models.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="form-and-representation-of-the-model"><strong><em>Form and representation of the model</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Conceptual model</strong> is a representation of entities and their relationships.
This is a broadly applicable term for many kinds of models.
It is prominent in the database and the ontology/logical communities
and very much depends on the term “entity”.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Physical model</strong> is a physical, touchable model (it hurts when
it falls on your feet).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Thought model</strong> (<strong>mental model</strong>) is the mental construction of a person to gain
an understanding of the system of interest.
It is argued that any explicit model is translated by the reading
person into an internal thought model.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Paper model</strong> (<strong>blackboard model</strong>)
is an informal drawing denoted on paper, a wall, or a board.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Explicit</strong> model is a model denoted in an <strong>explicit modeling language</strong>,
such as UML, SysML, or a domain-specific language.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Diagram</strong> is an explicit model denoted in a diagrammatic
modeling language, such as UML’s class diagrams or Statecharts.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Text model</strong> is an explicit model denoted in a textual
modeling language, such as UML’s OCL or MontiCore’s CD4A.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Programmed</strong> model is an implicit model that is encoded
in an executable program. The model is hidden in the code and mainly
usable for simulation. The programming language is not
to be confused with the (nonexisting) modeling language.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="how-the-model-came-into-existence"><strong><em>How the model came into existence</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Designed model</strong> is a model that has been created through human activity.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Learnt model</strong> is a model that has been constructed from data,
e.g., using one of the various machine learning techniques.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Derived model</strong> is a model that has been derived by some algorithm,
e.g., through abstraction, composition, transformation,
refinement, and other
algorithmically assistable derivation techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="what-the-model-is-used-for"><strong><em>What the model is used for</em></strong></h5>

<p>A similar categorization that however addresses a mixture between usage 
and origin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prescriptive model</strong> describes the system under
development before the system actually is developed.
This is typically a designed engineering model or it has been derived 
from designed models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Descriptive model</strong> describes a system that already 
exists. 
This is typically a designed scientific model, but also an
engineering model, 
when the system has been realized. Descriptive engineering models
allow to understand examine and optimize the already built system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prescriptive model</strong> also describes a system that already 
exists, but it has its origin in observations on the system. 
It is learnt from these observations and related forms of data and
has a rather implicit form, so that it cannot directly be examined, 
but executions, respectively queries produce answers, 
mainly to predict future behavior.
Machine learning is based on statistic correlations and does not
necessarily imply causality in such as form as covered by 
descriptive models.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="what-the-model-is-applied-on"><strong><em>What the model is applied on</em></strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Engineering model</strong> (<strong>Development model</strong>) is a model
that is used in a development project and denotes
the system under development. This includes software,
biological, mechanical,
chemical systems as well as social, economic, or producing processes.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Scientific model</strong> is a model that describes real-world phenomena
and is used to understand the existing world and its processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>“When the model doesn’t fit the modeled system, then the scientist says 
that the model is incorrect, while the engineer says the system was 
badly constructed.” (well known, true joke). We, however, observe 
models may serve both purposes because, e.g., biological science models 
may become bio-engineering models. In Computer Science, the situation 
is even more complicated because the existence of generators may change 
the purpose of a model from (scientific) understanding to constructive 
use and even to the implementation itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Metamodel</strong><br>
is a model describing some kind of meta-structure.
A common use is to define the abstract syntax of a modeling
language, which makes each model (or. to be exact: the model’s AST) 
an instance of the metamodel.
The MOF provides a hierarchy of metamodels, where finally,
the meta-meta-meta-model is an instance of itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the domain of language engineering, we thus
abandon fuzzy forms of uses and
only use the more narrow definition:</p>

<h5 id="parts-of-a-language"><strong><em>Parts of a language</em></strong></h5>

<p>A language is described by the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) <strong>Syntax</strong> (“representation” and “structure”)</li>
  <li>(2) <strong>Semantics</strong> (“meaning”)</li>
  <li>(3) <strong>Model library</strong> (“vocabulary”)</li>
  <li>(4) <strong>Pragmatics</strong> (“forms of use”)</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax of a language can be divided into the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1.1) <strong>Concrete syntax</strong>
</li>
  <li>(1.2) <strong>Abstract syntax (AST)</strong>
</li>
  <li>(1.2) <strong>Context conditions (CoCos)</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<h5 id="syntax"><strong><em>Syntax</em></strong></h5>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Concrete Syntax </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>The <strong>concrete syntax</strong> of a modeling language is used to
describe the concrete representation of the models and is
used by humans to read, understand, and create models. The
concrete syntax must be sufficiently formal to be
processible by tools.</p>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Abstract Syntax </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>The <strong>abstract syntax</strong> of a modeling language contains the
essential information of a model, disregarding all details
of the concrete syntax that do not contribute to the model’s
purpose. It is of particular interest for use by software
tools.</p>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<p>The abstract syntax (AST) of a model is then a 
concrete value of the AST of the language.</p>

<p>The abstract syntax is usually defined using context-free grammars or
class diagrams (also called “metamodels”). Both notations are limited
in their expressiveness, and thus, it is usually necessary to add
additional constraints to restrict the set of models to 
define the <strong>well-formed models</strong>:</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Context Conditions </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Context conditions</strong>
are boolean predicates constraining
the set of models to the subset of well-formed models.</p>

  
</div>

<p>Context conditions are thus also called <strong>well-formedness rules</strong>.
Sometimes also, “static semantics” is used, but we regard this term
as misleading because context conditions do not tell us anything about
the meaning (i.e. semantics) but purely constrain the syntax.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<h5 id="semantics"><strong><em>Semantics</em></strong></h5>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Semantics </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>The <strong>semantics</strong> of a modeling
language captures the essential information of its models in
the form of an explicitly defined</p>

    <ul>
      <li>syntactic domain that describes all well-formed models,</li>
      <li>a semantic domain that captures all essential information
that the models can describe, and</li>
      <li>a semantic mapping that relates the syntactic constructs
of the models to the semantic domain.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<p>Special forms of semantics are (1) <strong>denotational semantics</strong>,
(2) <strong>axiomatic semantics</strong>, and (3) <strong>operational semantics</strong>
using different techniques and serving different purposes.
We only look further at denotational semantics.
It describes what a model means without talking
about how this meaning is actually achieved. Denotational semantics
is typically defined using mathematical constructs. As a result, it is
quite abstract and typically requires some training in mathematics to
understand. Its advantage is that because we have the full power of
mathematics at hand, we do not have to suffer from computational
limitations and can, e.g., adequately address the principle of
underspecification.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<h5 id="model-library"><strong><em>Model Library</em></strong></h5>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Model Library </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>model library</strong>
is a collection of relatively independent models that are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>defined for use in other models through 
language-specific forms of import (reference),
refinement, or adaptation and</li>
      <li>that can be composed with other models.</li>
    </ul>

  
</div>

<p>The existence of a library of reusable models is one key success
factor for a language to become used in practice.
Models only become reusable as independent, modular
artifacts that can be
somehow “imported”, “waved”, “merged”, or otherwise <strong>composed</strong>
if appropriate operators exist.
While modularity and, thus, extensive libraries
are a standard in modern programming languages,
many modeling languages
suffer from inadequate or even missing composition operators and
missing reusable libraries.
Sometimes this is due to a lack of modularity in the
modeling language itself.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Tool </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>(software) tool</strong> is a program that is employed in
the development, repair, or enhancement of software programs.</p>

  
</div>

<p>Software tools can assist developers in all activities of all phases
of a software life cycle, including management, quality assurance,
requirements elicitation, design, implementation, integration,
deployment, evolution, optimization, and automation activities.
Software tools can also be used during the operation of the
developed software program for its monitoring, debugging, repair, 
configuration, or other forms of analysis.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Language Workbench </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>language workbench</strong> is a tool
that provides a set of techniques supporting the development and
evolution of a language and its associated tooling, including design,
implementation, deployment, evolution, reuse, and maintenance.</p>

  
</div>

<p><a href="https://monticore.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MontiCore</a>, as described in
<a href="#HKR21">[HKR21]</a>, is such a language workbench.</p>

<p>A language workbench can also be called a “<em>meta-tool</em>” as its focus are
tools as products. A language workbench can also be used to recursively
develop parts of itself.</p>

<p>Tools can be categorized according to the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An <strong>API-based tool</strong> is essentially a set of methods that can be
called to execute the functionality within an already existing process.
The set of methods is specific to the tool’s functionality.</li>
  <li>A <strong>command-line tool</strong> is an executable artifact that can be called
from a command-line shell or a script and runs in its own virtual
process space.</li>
  <li>A <strong>plugin</strong> is a special form of API-based tool, where the API
is predefined by an integrated development environment (IDE),
in which a tool is pluggable when it realizes that API.
The tool’s API is IDE-dependent but rather independent of the tool’s 
functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accordingly, there are several kinds of sources used, and results
tools can produce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data may be available as an object structure within the program,
which may be manipulated directly (API-based tools only).</li>
  <li>The data may be available as an artifact (file) in the directory
and thus must be loaded or parsed into an internal representation.</li>
  <li>The data may be stored in a database and needs retrieval.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although every set of methods might be regarded as an API and, therefore,
as an API-based tool,
we suggest that certain forms of coherent functionalities
with adequate granularity should be called a tool.
In practice, many tools come with both API and CLI interfaces because, 
typically,
a <em>main</em> class method translates external invocation to internal
API calls.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Tool Workflow </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>tool workflow</strong> is a combination of tool executions in a
predefined order used to produce certain results in a
fully automated form.</p>

  
</div>

<p>Development workflows, in general, may also involve developers, testers, or
lead users, and there are some development processes where these workflows
are made explicit.
A tool workflow focuses only on the automation aspect, allowing
the workflow to be executed fully automatically.
This may happen upon each relevant software change (e.g., version commit),
daily overnight, when certain stages, e.g., release, are reached, etc.
Essentially a dual workflow can be defined using a purely sequential
script, but various efficiency optimizations are very helpful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1) the workflow should be executed incrementally, where only the
necessary actions are repeated, and earlier intermediate results are reused,</li>
  <li>(2) the users don’t have to care about the action dependencies,
but the workflow manager itself knows how to sequentialize
the defined actions and also
when actions can be executed in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gradle</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> are such workflow managers if configured well.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Definition: Model Engineering </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Model Engineering</strong> comprises all
activities around the creation, transformation, analysis,
and management of models and
their related artifacts
with the purpose of assisting software and systems
development or real-world understanding.</p>

  
</div>

<p>To better support the use of models during development, it
will become necessary to further understand models in terms
of how they can be transformed and analyzed, as well as
understand the impact of software size and complexity on
model creation, management, and evolution. We expect that
“Model Engineering” will become a new and highly interesting
sub-discipline in the Software Engineering discipline.</p>

<p>As a consequence: <strong>Model Engineering</strong> might be considered a
new subdiscipline of Software Engineering.</p>

<p>The following definitions describe a number of operations on models.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<h5 id="forms-of-model-operations-and-relations"><strong><em>Forms of Model Operations and Relations</em></strong></h5>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Model Transformation </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>A <strong>model transformation</strong>
applies to one or more source models and transforms them
into one or more target models.</p>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Refactoring </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Refactoring</strong> is a relation between two models. Model B is
a refactoring of model A if all information that model A
contains about the modeled system can also be derived from
model B, but not more.</p>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Refinement </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Refinement</strong> is a relation between two models. Model B is
a refinement of model A if all information that can be
derived from model A can also be derived from model B.</p>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>
  
</div>

<p>While refactoring is typically regarded as “horizontal”, i.e.,
remaining on the level of abstraction, refinement is regarded as
“vertical”, i.e., downstream from abstract requirements to concrete
realization. Refactoring enables evolution.</p>

<p>Refinement is only possible if the modeling language itself provides
forms of abstractions, which allow the omission of details, but also 
through explicit <strong>underspecification</strong> by using special 
language constructs.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">
    
    <h4 class="no_toc"> Model Composition </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
<p>Given two independently defined models, <strong>model
composition</strong> is an operator to combine both models into
one, such that their individual semantics is retained and
certain details of the models are encapsulated.</p>

    <p>(definition from <a href="#CFJ+16">[CFJ+16]</a>)</p>

  
</div>

<p>Composition of models
enables developers to decompose a problem and solve the resulting
smaller problems separately, in parallel, and in a modular form.
Even more, composition of models enables reusing predefined solutions, i.e. 
through reuse of models for example from a library.</p>

<p>It is noteable that composition may not only be applied to models.
Related, but also to some extent orthogonal are
<em>component composition</em>, <em>tool composition</em>, tool <em>workflow composition</em>,
and <em>language composition</em>.</p>

<div class="definition no_toc_section">

    <p>

<p><strong>Model analysis</strong> comprises all

      <li>to understand or query the properties and consequences
defined in a model,</li>
      <li>to ensure the model quality, and</li>
      <li>to understand the properties of the modeled software,
system, or real world.</li>
    </ul>

  
</div>

<p>Code generation comprises all constructive activities, including the
generation of tests, reports, documentation, and configurations,
while model analysis comprises all analytic activities, including
static analysis with formal methods on certain possible deficiencies,
simulation of executable models for analyzing dynamic behavior
in a relevant subset of scenarios, or testing.
We distinguish high-level, complex analysis, e.g., with metric results
from simple context conditions, which at this point have already 
been checked.</p>

<p>Model analysis deals with the questions of</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) whether the model itself is of high quality,</li>
  <li>(2) whether the model fits the modeled software,
system, or real world, and</li>
  <li>(3) what analysis techniques must be provided for developers
to enable them to retrieve useful information from the model.</li>
</ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<h5 id="development-processes"><strong><em>Development Processes</em></strong></h5>

<p>Development activities are organized in development processes,
which are classifiable according to the following definitions.</p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Model-based Software Engineering</strong> (MBSE) is the use

    <p>

    </p>
<p><strong>Model-based Systems Engineering</strong> (MBSysE) is the formalized
application of modeling to support system requirements,
design, analysis, verification, and validation activities
beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing
throughout development and later life cycle phases.</p>

    <p>(from INCOSE SE Vision 2020)</p>
  
</div>

<ul>
  <li>In <strong>Model-based development (MBD)</strong>,
models are used in some activities of development, but the
activities and their order basically remain the traditional
development activities.</li>
  <li>In <strong>Model-driven development (MDD)</strong>, models also drive and guide
the development process, and thus, models are the primary
engineering artifacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Model-driven development is much more helpful because the use of
models must drive the process in such a way that other activities can
be omitted or at least considerably reduced, such that the overall
process becomes more efficient, more timely, and produces better
results.</p>
